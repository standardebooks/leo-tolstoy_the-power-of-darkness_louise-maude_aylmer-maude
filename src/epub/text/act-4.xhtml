			<h2>ACT IV</h2>
			<p class="scene">Autumn. Evening. The moon is shining. The stage represents the interior of courtyard. The scenery at the back shows, in the middle, the back porch of the hut. To the right the winter half of the hut and the gate; to the left the summer half and the cellar. To the right of the stage is a shed. The sound of tipsy voices and shouts are heard from the hut.<a class="fnanchor" href="#Footnote_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5" name="FNanchor_5_5">[5]</a> Second Neighbour Woman comes out of the hut and beckons to First Neighbour Woman.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">SECOND NEIGHBOUR.</span> How's it Akoulína has not shown herself?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">FIRST NEIGHBOUR.</span> Why hasn't she shown herself? She'd have been glad to; but she's too ill, you know. The suitor's relatives have come, and want to see the girl; and she, my dear, she's lying in the cold hut and can't come out, poor thing!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">SECOND NEIGHBOUR.</span> But how's that?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">FIRST NEIGHBOUR.</span> They say she's been bewitched by an evil eye! She's got pains in the stomach!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">SECOND NEIGHBOUR.</span> You don't say so?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">FIRST NEIGHBOUR.</span> What else could it be? [<i>Whispers</i>].</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">SECOND NEIGHBOUR.</span> Dear me! There's a go! But his relatives will surely find it out?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">FIRST NEIGHBOUR.</span> They find it out! They're all drunk! Besides, they are chiefly after her dowry. Just think what they give with the girl! Two furs, my dear, six dresses, a French shawl, and I don't know how many pieces of linen, and money as well,—two hundred roubles, it's said!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">SECOND NEIGHBOUR.</span> That's all very well, but even money can't give much pleasure in the face of such a disgrace.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">FIRST NEIGHBOUR.</span> Hush!… There's his father, I think.</p>
			<p>
				<i>They cease talking, and go into the hut.</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>The Suitor's Father comes out of the hut hiccoughing.</i>
			</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">THE FATHER.</span> Oh, I'm all in a sweat. It's awfully hot! Will just cool myself a bit. [<i>Stands puffing</i>] The Lord only knows what—something is not right. I can't feel happy.—Well, it's the old woman's affair.</p>
			<p>
				<i>Enter Matryóna from hut.</i>
			</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> And I was just thinking, where's the father? Where's the father? And here you are, dear friend.… Well, dear friend, the Lord be thanked! Everything is as honourable as can be! When one's arranging a match one should not boast. And I have never learnt to boast. But as you've come about the right business, so with the Lord's help, you'll be grateful to me all your life! She's a wonderful girl! There's no other like her in all the district!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">THE FATHER.</span> That's true enough, but how about the money?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Don't you trouble about the money! All she had from her father goes with her. And it's more than one gets easily, as things are nowadays. Three times fifty roubles!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">THE FATHER.</span> We don't complain, but it's for our own child. Naturally we want to get the best we can.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> I'll tell you straight, friend: if it hadn't been for me, you'd never have found anything like her! They've had an offer from the Karmílins, but I stood out against it. And as for the money, I'll tell you truly: when her father, God be merciful to his soul, was dying, he gave orders that the widow should take Nikíta into the homestead—of course I know all about it from my son,—and the money was to go to Akoulína. Why, another one might have thought of his own interests, but Nikíta gives everything clean! It's no trifle. Fancy what a sum it is!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">THE FATHER.</span> People are saying, that more money was left her? The lad's sharp too!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Oh, dear soul alive! A slice in another's hand always looks big; all she had will be handed over. I tell you, throw doubts to the wind and make all sure! What a girl she is! as fresh as a daisy!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">THE FATHER.</span> That's so. But my old woman and I were only wondering about the girl; why has she not come out? We've been thinking, suppose she's sickly?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Oh, ah.… Who? She? Sickly? Why, there's none to compare with her in the district. The girl's as sound as a bell; you can't pinch her. But you saw her the other day! And as for work, she's wonderful! She's a bit deaf, that's true, but there are spots on the sun, you know. And her not coming out, you see, it's from an evil eye! A spell's been cast on her! And I know the bitch who's done the business! They know of the betrothal and they bewitched her. But I know a counter-spell. The girl will get up to-morrow. Don't you worry about the girl!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">THE FATHER.</span> Well, of course, the thing's settled.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Yes, of course! Don't you turn back. And don't forget me, I've had a lot of trouble. Don't forget …</p>
			<p>
				<i>A woman's voice from the hut.</i>
			</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">VOICE.</span> If we are to go, let's go. Come along, Iván!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">THE FATHER.</span> I'm coming. [<i>Exeunt. Guests crowd together in the passage and prepare to go away</i>].</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN</span> [<i>runs out of the hut and calls to Anísya</i>] Mother!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>from inside</i>] What d'you want?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Mother, come here, or they'll hear.</p>
			<p>
				<i>Anísya enters and they go together to the shed.</i>
			</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Well? What is it? Where's Akoulína?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> She's gone into the barn. It's awful what's she's doing there! I'm blest! “I can't bear it,” she says. “I'll scream,” she says, “I'll scream out loud.” Blest if she didn't.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> She'll have to wait. We'll see our visitors off first.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Oh mother! She's so bad! And she's angry too. “What's the good of their drinking my health?” she says. “I shan't marry,” she says. “I shall die,” she says. Mother, supposing she does die! It's awful. I'm so frightened!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> No fear, she'll not die. But don't you go near her. Come along. [<i>Exit Anísya and Nan</i>].</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH</span> [<i>comes in at the gate and begins collecting the scattered hay</i>] Oh Lord! Merciful Nicholas! What a lot of liquor they've been and swilled, and the smell they've made! It smells even out here! But no, I don't want any, drat it! See how they've scattered the hay about. They don't eat it, but only trample it under foot. A truss gone before you know it. Oh, that smell, it seems to be just under my nose! Drat it! [<i>Yawns</i>] It's time to go to sleep! But I don't care to go into the hut. It seems to float just round my nose! It has a strong scent, the damned stuff! [<i>The guests are heard driving off</i>] They're off at last. Oh Lord! Merciful Nicholas! There they go, binding themselves and gulling one another. And it's all gammon!</p>
			<p>
				<i>Enter Nikíta.</i>
			</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Mítritch, you get off to sleep and I'll put this straight.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> All right, you throw it to the sheep. Well, have you seen 'em all off?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Yes, they're off! But things are not right! I don't know what to do!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> It's a fine mess. But there's the Foundlings'<a class="fnanchor" href="#Footnote_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6" name="FNanchor_6_6">[6]</a> for that sort of thing. Whoever likes may drop one there; they'll take 'em all. Give 'em as many as you like, they ask no questions, and even pay—if the mother goes in as a wet-nurse. It's easy enough nowadays.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> But mind, Mítritch, don't go blabbing.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> It's no concern of mine. Cover the tracks as you think best. Dear me, how you smell of liquor! I'll go in. Oh Lord! [<i>Exit, yawning</i>].</p>
			<p>
				<i>Nikíta is long silent. Sits down on a sledge.</i>
			</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Here's a go!</p>
			<p>
				<i>Enter Anísya.</i>
			</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Where are you?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Here.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> What are you doing there? There's no time to be lost! We must take it out directly!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> What are we to do?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> I'll tell you what you are to do. And you'll have to do it!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> You'd better take it to the Foundlings'—if anything.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Then you'd better take it there yourself if you like! You've a hankering for smut, but you're weak when it comes to settling up, I see!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> What's to be done?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Go down into the cellar, I tell you, and dig a hole!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Couldn't you manage, somehow, some other way?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>imitating him</i>] “Some other way?” Seems we can't “some other way!” You should have thought about it a year ago. Do what you're told to!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Oh dear, what a go!</p>
			<p>
				<i>Enter Nan.</i>
			</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Mother! Grandmother's calling! I think sister's got a baby! I'm blest if it didn't scream!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> What are you babbling about? Plague take you! It's kittens whining there. Go into the hut and sleep, or I'll give it you!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Mammy dear, truly, I swear …</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>raising her arm as if to strike</i>] I'll give it you! You be off and don't let me catch sight of you! [<i>Nan runs into hut. To Nikíta</i>] Do as you're told, or else mind! [<i>Exit</i>].</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>alone. After a long silence</i>] Here's a go! Oh these women! What a fix! Says you should have thought of it a year ago. When's one to think beforehand? When's one to think? Why, last year this Anísya dangled after me. What was I to do? Am I a monk? The master died; and I covered my sin as was proper, so I was not to blame there. Aren't there lots of such cases? And then those powders. Did I put her up to that? Why, had I known what the bitch was up to, I'd have killed her! I'm sure I should have killed her! She's made me her partner in these horrors—that jade! And she became loathsome to me from that day! She became loathsome, loathsome to me as soon as mother told me about it. I can't bear the sight of her! Well then, how could I live with her? And then it begun.… That wench began hanging round. Well, what was I to do! If I had not done it, someone else would. And this is what comes of it! Still I'm not to blame in this either. Oh, what a go! [<i>Sits thinking</i>] They are bold, these women! What a plan to think of! But I won't have a hand in it!</p>
			<p>
				<i>Enter Matryóna with a lantern and spade, panting.</i>
			</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Why are you sitting there like a hen on a perch? What did your wife tell you to do? You just get things ready!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> What do you mean to do?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> We know what to do. You do your share!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> You'll be getting me into a mess!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> What? You're not thinking of backing out, are you? Now it's come to this, and you back out!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Think what a thing it would be! It's a living soul.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> A living soul indeed! Why, it's more dead than alive. And what's one to do with it? Go and take it to the Foundlings'—it will die just the same, and the rumour will get about, and people will talk, and the girl be left on our hands.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> And supposing it's found out?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Not manage to do it in one's own house? We'll manage it so that no one will have an inkling. Only do as I tell you. We women can't do it without a man. There, take the spade, and get it done there,—I'll hold the light.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> What am I to get done?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> [<i>in a low voice</i>] Dig a hole; then we'll bring it out and get it out of the way in a trice! There, she's calling again. Now then, get in, and I'll go.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Is it dead then?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Of course it is. Only you must be quick, or else people will notice! They'll see or they'll hear! The rascals must needs know everything. And the policeman went by this evening. Well then, you see [<i>gives him the spade</i>], you get down into the cellar and dig a hole right in the corner; the earth is soft there, and you'll smooth it over. Mother earth will not blab to any one; she'll keep it close. Go then; go, dear.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> You'll get me into a mess, bother you! I'll go away! You do it alone as best you can!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>through the doorway</i>] Well? Has he dug it?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Why have you come away? What have you done with it?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> I've covered it with rags. No one can hear it. Well, has he dug it?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> He doesn't want to!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>springs out enraged</i>] Doesn't want to! How will he like feeding vermin in prison! I'll go straight away and tell everything to the police! It's all the same if one must perish. I'll go straight and tell!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>taken aback</i>] What will you tell?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> What? Everything! Who took the money? You! [<i>Nikíta is silent</i>] And who gave the poison? I did! But you knew! You knew! You knew! We were in agreement!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> That's enough now. Nikíta dear, why are you obstinate? What's to be done now? One must take some trouble. Go, honey.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> See the fine gentleman! He doesn't like it! You've put upon me long enough! You've trampled me under foot! Now it's my turn! Go, I tell you, or else I'll do what I said.… There, take the spade; there, now go!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Drat you! Can't you leave a fellow alone! [<i>Takes the spade, but shrinks</i>] If I don't choose to, I'll not go!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Not go? [<i>Begins to shout</i>] Neighbours! Heh! heh!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> [<i>closes her mouth</i>] What are you about? You're mad! He'll go.… Go, sonnie; go, my own.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> I'll cry murder!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Now stop! Oh what people! You'd better be quick.… As well be hung for a sheep as a lamb! [<i>Goes towards the cellar</i>].</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Yes, that's just it, honey. If you know how to amuse yourself, you must know how to hide the consequences.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>still excited</i>] He's trampled on me … he and his slut! But it's enough! I'm not going to be the only one! Let him also be a murderer! Then he'll know how it feels!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> There, there! How she flares up! Don't you be cross, lass, but do things quietly little by little, as it's best. You go to the girl, and he'll do the work. [<i>Follows Nikíta to the cellar with a lantern. He descends into the cellar</i>].</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> And I'll make him strangle his dirty brat! [<i>Still excited</i>] I've worried myself to death all alone, with Peter's bones weighing on my mind! Let him feel it too! I'll not spare myself; I've said I'll not spare myself!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>from the cellar</i>] Show a light!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> [<i>holds up the lantern to him. To Anísya</i>] He's digging. Go and bring it.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> You stay with him, or he'll go away, the wretch! And I'll go and bring it.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Mind, don't forget to baptize it, or I will if you like. Have you a cross?</p>
			<p><a id="end-act4" name="end-act4"><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span></a> I'll find one. I know how to do it. [<i>Exit</i>].</p>
			<p class="variation">See at end of Act, <a href="#variation">Variation</a>, which may be used instead of the following.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> How the woman bristled up! But one must allow she's been put upon. Well, but with the Lord's help, when we've covered this business, there'll be an end of it. We'll shove the girl off without any trouble. My son will live in comfort. The house, thank God, is as full as an egg. They'll not forget me either. Where would they have been without Matryóna? They'd not have known how to contrive things. [<i>Peering into the cellar</i>] Is it ready, sonnie?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>puts out his head</i>] What are you about there? Bring it quick! What are you dawdling for? If it is to be done, let it be done.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> [<i>goes towards door of the hut and meets Anísya. Anísya comes out with a baby wrapped in rags</i>] Well, have you baptized it?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Why, of course! It was all I could do to take it away—she wouldn't give it up! [<i>Comes forward and hands it to Nikíta</i>].</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>does not take it</i>] You bring it yourself!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Take it, I tell you! [<i>Throws the baby to him</i>].</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>catches it</i>] It's alive! Gracious me, it's moving! It's alive! What am I to …</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>snatches the baby from him and throws it into the cellar</i>] Be quick and smother it, and then it won't be alive! [<i>Pushes Nikíta down</i>] It's your doing, and you must finish it.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> [<i>sits on the doorstep of the hut</i>] He's tender-hearted. It's hard on him, poor dear. Well, what of that? Isn't it also his sin?</p>
			<p>
				<i>Anísya stands by the cellar.</i>
			</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> [<i>sits looking at her and discourses</i>] Oh, oh, oh! How frightened he was: well, but what of that? If it <em>is</em> hard, it's the only thing to be done. Where was one to put it? And just think, how often it happens that people pray to God to have children! But no, God gives them none; or they are all still-born. Look at our priest's wife now.… And here, where it's not wanted, here it lives. [<i>Looks towards the cellar</i>] I suppose he's finished. [<i>To Anísya</i>] Well?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>looking into the cellar</i>] He's put a board on it and is sitting on it. It must be finished!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Oh, oh! One would be glad not to sin, but what's one to do?</p>
			<p>
				<i>Re-enter Nikíta from cellar, trembling all over.</i>
			</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> It's still alive! I can't! It's alive!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> If it's alive, where are you off to? [<i>Tries to stop him</i>].</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>rushes at her</i>] Go away! I'll kill you! [<i>Catches hold of her arms; she escapes, he runs after her with the spade. Matryóna runs towards him and stops him. Anísya runs into the porch. Matryóna tries to wrench the spade from him. To his mother</i>] I'll kill you! I'll kill you! Go away! [<i>Matryóna runs to Anísya in the porch. Nikíta stops</i>] I'll kill you! I'll kill you all!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> That's because he's so frightened! Never mind, it will pass!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> What have they made me do? What have they made me do? How it whimpered.… How it crunched under me! What have they done with me?… And it's really alive, still alive! [<i>Listens in silence</i>] It's whimpering … There, it's whimpering. [<i>Runs to the cellar</i>].</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> [<i>to Anísya</i>] He's going; it seems he means to bury it. Nikíta, you'd better take the lantern!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>does not heed her, but listens by the cellar door</i>] I can hear nothing! I suppose it was fancy! [<i>Moves away, then stops</i>] How the little bones crunched under me. Krr … kr … What have they made me do? [<i>Listens again</i>] Again whimpering! It's really whimpering! What can it be? Mother! Mother, I say! [<i>Goes up to her</i>].</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> What is it, sonnie?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Mother, my own mother, I can't do any more! Can't do any more! My own mother, have some pity on me!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Oh dear, how frightened you are, my darling! Come, come, drink a drop to give you courage!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Mother, mother! It seems my time has come! What have you done with me? How the little bones crunched, and how it whimpered! My own mother! What have you done with me? [<i>Steps aside and sits down on the sledge</i>].</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Come, my own, have a drink! It certainly does seem uncanny at night-time. But wait a bit. When the day breaks, you know, and one day and another passes, you'll forget even to think of it. Wait a bit; when the girl's married we'll even forget to think of it. But you go and have a drink; have a drink! I'll go and put things straight in the cellar myself.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>rouses himself</i>] Is there any drink left? Perhaps I can drink it off! [<i>Exit</i>].</p>
			<p>
				<i>Anísya, who has stood all the time by the door, silently makes way for him.</i>
			</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Go, go, honey, and I'll set to work! I'll go down myself and dig! Where has he thrown the spade to? [<i>Finds the spade, and goes down into the cellar</i>] Anísya, come here! Hold the light, will you?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> And what of him?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> He's so frightened! You've been too hard with him. Leave him alone, he'll come to his senses. God help him! I'll set to work myself. Put the lantern down here. I can see.</p>
			<p>
				<i>Matryóna disappears into the cellar.</i>
			</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>looking towards the door by which Nikíta entered the hut</i>] Well, have you had enough spree? You've been puffing yourself up, but now you'll know how it feels! You'll lose some of your bluster!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>rushes out of the hut towards the cellar</i>] Mother! mother, I say!</p>

			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> How can it whimper? Why, you've flattened it into a pancake! The whole head is smashed to bits!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> What is it then? [<i>Stops his ears</i>] It's still whimpering! I am lost! Lost! What have they done with me?… Where shall I go? [<i>Sits down on the step</i>].</p>

			<h4 class="smcap">Scene 2.</h4>
			<p class="scene">The interior of the hut as in <a href="#act1">Act I</a>.</p>
			<p class="scene">Nan lies on the bench, and is covered with a coat. Mítritch is sitting on the oven smoking.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Dear me! How they've made the place smell! Drat 'em! They've been spilling the fine stuff. Even tobacco don't get rid of the smell! It keeps tickling one's nose so. Oh Lord! But it's bedtime, I guess. [<i>Approaches the lamp to put it out</i>].</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN</span> [<i>jumps up, and remains sitting up</i>] Daddy dear,<a class="fnanchor" href="#Footnote_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7" name="FNanchor_7_7">[7]</a> don't put it out!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Not put it out? Why?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Didn't you hear them making a row in the yard? [<i>Listens</i>] D'you hear, there in the barn again now?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> What's that to you? I guess no one's asked you to mind! Lie down and sleep! And I'll turn down the light. [<i>Turns down lamp</i>].</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Daddy darling! Don't put it right out; leave a little bit if only as big as a mouse's eye, else it's so frightening!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH</span> [<i>laughs</i>] All right, all right. [<i>Sits down by her</i>] What's there to be afraid of?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> How can one help being frightened, daddy! Sister did go on so! She was beating her head against the box! [<i>Whispers</i>] You know, I know … a little baby is going to be born.… It's already born, I think.…</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Eh, what a little busybody it is! May the frogs kick her! Must needs know everything. Lie down and sleep! [<i>Nan lies down</i>] That's right! [<i>Tucks her up</i>] That's right! There now, if you know too much you'll grow old too soon.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> And you are going to lie on the oven?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Well, of course! What a little silly you are, now I come to look at you! Must needs know everything. [<i>Tucks her up again, then stands up to go</i>] There now, lie still and sleep! [<i>Goes up to the oven</i>].</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> It gave just one cry, and now there's nothing to be heard.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Oh Lord! Gracious Nicholas! What is it you can't hear?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> The baby.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> There is none, that's why you can't hear it.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> But I heard it! Blest if I didn't hear it! Such a thin voice!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Heard indeed! Much you heard! Well, if you know,—why then it was just such a little girl as you that the bogey popped into his bag and made off with.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> What bogey?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Why, just his very self! [<i>Climbs up on to the oven</i>] The oven is beautifully warm to-night. Quite a treat! Oh Lord! Gracious Nicholas!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Daddy! are you going to sleep?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> What else? Do you think I'm going to sing songs?</p>
			<p>
				<i>Silence.</i>
			</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Daddy! Daddy, I say! They are digging! they're digging—don't you hear? Blest if they're not, they're digging!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> What are you dreaming about? Digging! Digging in the night! Who's digging? The cow's rubbing herself, that's all. Digging indeed! Go to sleep I tell you, else I'll just put out the light!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Daddy darling, don't put it out! I won't … truly, truly, I won't. It's so frightful!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Frightful? Don't be afraid and then it won't be frightful. Look at her, she's afraid, and then says it's frightful. How can it help being frightful if you are afraid? Eh, what a stupid little girl!</p>
			<p>
				<i>Silence. The cricket chirps.</i>
			</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN</span> [<i>whispers</i>] Daddy! I say, daddy! Are you asleep?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Now then, what d'you want?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> What's the bogey like?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Why, like this! When he finds such a one as you, who won't sleep, he comes with a sack and pops the girl into it, then in he gets himself, head and all, lifts her dress, and gives her a fine whipping!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> What with?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> He takes a birch-broom with him.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> But he can't see there—inside the sack!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> He'll see, no fear!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> But I'll bite him.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> No, friend, him you can't bite!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Daddy, there's some one coming! Who is it? Oh gracious goodness! Who can it be?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Well, if some one's coming, let them come! What's the matter with you? I suppose it's your mother!</p>
			<p>
				<i>Enter Anísya.</i>
			</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Nan! [<i>Nan pretends to be asleep</i>] Mítritch!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> What?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> What's the lamp burning for? We are going to sleep in the summer-hut.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Why, you see I've only just got straight. I'll put the light out all right.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>rummages in her box and grumbles</i>] When a thing's wanted one never can find it!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Why, what is it you are looking for?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> I'm looking for a cross. Suppose it were to die unbaptized! It would be a sin, you know!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Of course it would! Everything in due order.… Have you found it?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Yes, I've found it. [<i>Exit</i>].</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> That's right, else I'd have lent her mine. Oh Lord!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN</span> [<i>jumps up trembling</i>] Oh, oh, daddy! Don't go to sleep; for goodness' sake, don't! It's so frightful!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> What's frightful?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> It will die—the little baby will! At Aunt Irene's the old woman also baptized the baby, and it died!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> If it dies, they'll bury it!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> But maybe it wouldn't have died, only old Granny Matryóna's there! Didn't I hear what granny was saying? I heard her! Blest if I didn't!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> What did you hear? Go to sleep, I tell you. Cover yourself up, head and all, and let's have an end of it!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> If it lived, I'd nurse it!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH</span> [<i>roars</i>] Oh Lord!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Where will they put it?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> In the right place! It's no business of yours! Go to sleep I tell you, else mother will come; she'll give it you! [<i>Silence</i>].</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Daddy! Eh, daddy! That girl, you know, you were telling about—they didn't kill her?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> That girl? Oh yes. That girl turned out all right!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> How was it? You were saying you found her?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Well, we just found her!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> But where did you find her? Do tell!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Why, in their own house; that's where! We came to a village, the soldiers began hunting about in the house, when suddenly there's that same little girl lying on the floor, flat on her stomach. We were going to give her a knock on the head, but all at once I felt that sorry, that I took her up in my arms; but no, she wouldn't let me! Made herself so heavy, quite a hundredweight, and caught hold where she could with her hands, so that one couldn't get them off! Well, so I began stroking her head. It was so bristly,—just like a hedgehog! So I stroked and stroked, and she quieted down at last. I soaked a bit of rusk and gave it her. She understood that, and began nibbling. What were we to do with her? We took her; took her, and began feeding and feeding her, and she got so used to us that we took her with us on the march, and so she went about with us. Ah, she was a fine girl!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Yes, and not baptized?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Who can tell! They used to say, not altogether. 'Cos why, those people weren't our own.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Germans?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> What an idea! Germans! Not Germans, but Asiatics. They are just the same as Jews, but still not Jews. Polish, yet Asiatics. Curls … or, Curdlys is their name.… I've forgotten what it is!<a class="fnanchor" href="#Footnote_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8" name="FNanchor_8_8">[8]</a> We called the girl Sáshka. She was a fine girl, Sáshka was! There now, I've forgotten everything I used to know! But that girl—the deuce take her—seems to be before my eyes now! Out of all my time of service, I remember how they flogged me, and I remember that girl. That's all I remember! She'd hang round one's neck, and one 'ud carry her so. That was a girl,—if you wanted a better you'd not find one! We gave her away afterwards. The captain's wife took her to bring up as her daughter. So—she was all right! How sorry the soldiers were to let her go!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> There now, daddy, and I remember when father was dying,—you were not living with us then. Well, he called Nikíta and says, “Forgive me, Nikíta!” he says, and begins to cry. [<i>Sighs</i>] That also felt very sad!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Yes; there now, so it is …</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Daddy! Daddy, I say! There they are again, making a noise in the cellar! Oh gracious heavens! Oh dear! Oh dear! Oh, daddy! They'll do something to it! They'll make away with it, and it's so little! Oh, oh! [<i>Covers up her head and cries</i>].</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH</span> [<i>listening</i>] Really they're up to some villainy, blow them to shivers! Oh, these women are vile creatures! One can't say much for men either; but women!… They are like wild beasts, and stick at nothing!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN</span> [<i>rising</i>] Daddy; I say, daddy!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Well, what now?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> The other day a traveller stayed the night; he said that when an infant died its soul goes up straight to heaven. Is that true?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Who can tell. I suppose so. Well?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Oh, it would be best if I died too. [<i>Whimpers</i>].</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Then you'd be off the list!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Up to ten one's an infant, and maybe one's soul would go to God. Else one's sure to go to the bad!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> And how to the bad? How should the likes of you not go to the bad? Who teaches you? What do you see? What do you hear? Only vileness! I, though I've not been taught much, still know a thing or two. I'm not quite like a peasant woman. A peasant woman, what is she? Just mud! There are many millions of the likes of you in Russia, and all as blind as moles—knowing nothing! All sorts of spells: how to stop the cattle-plague with a plough, and how to cure children by putting them under the perches in the hen-house! That's what they know!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Yes, mother also did that!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Yes,—there it is,—just so! So many millions of girls and women, and all like beasts in a forest! As she grows up, so she dies! Never sees anything; never hears anything. A peasant,—he may learn something at the pub, or maybe in prison, or in the army,—as I did. But a woman? Let alone about God, she doesn't even know rightly what Friday it is! Friday! Friday! But ask her what's Friday? She don't know! They're like blind puppies, creeping about and poking their noses into the dung-heap.… All they know are their silly songs. Ho, ho, ho, ho! But what they mean by ho-ho, they don't know themselves!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> But I, daddy, I do know half the Lord's Prayer!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> A lot you know! But what can one expect of you? Who teaches you? Only a tipsy peasant—with the strap perhaps! That's all the teaching you get! I don't know who'll have to answer for you. For a recruit, the drill-sergeant or the corporal has to answer; but for the likes of you there's no one responsible! Just as the cattle that have no herdsman are the most mischievous, so with you women—you are the stupidest class! The most foolish class is yours!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Then what's one to do?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> That's what one has to do.… You just cover up your head and sleep! Oh Lord!</p>
			<p>
				<i>Silence. The cricket chirps.</i>
			</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN</span> [<i>jumps up</i>] Daddy! Some one's screaming awfully! Blest if some one isn't screaming! Daddy darling, it's coming here!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Cover up your head, I tell you!</p>
			<p>
				<i>Enter Nikíta, followed by Matryóna.</i>
			</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> What have they done with me? What have they done with me?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Have a drop, honey; have a drop of drink! What's the matter? [<i>Fetches the spirits and sets the bottle before him</i>].</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Give it here! Perhaps the drink will help me!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Mind! They're not asleep! Here you are, have a drop!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> What does it all mean? Why did you plan it? You might have taken it somewhere!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> [<i>whispers</i>] Sit still a bit and drink a little more, or have a smoke. It will ease your thoughts!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> My own mother! My turn seems to have come! How it began to whimper, and how the little bones crunched … krr … I'm not a man now!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Eh, now, what's the use of talking so silly! Of course it does seem fearsome at night, but wait till the daylight comes, and a day or two passes, and you'll forget to think of it! [<i>Goes up to Nikíta and puts her hand on his shoulder</i>].</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Go away from me! What have you done with me?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Come, come, sonnie! Now really, what's the matter with you? [<i>Takes his hand</i>].</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Go away from me! I'll kill you! It's all one to me now! I'll kill you!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Oh, oh, how frightened he's got! You should go and have a sleep now!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> I have nowhere to go; I'm lost!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> [<i>shaking her head</i>] Oh, oh, I'd better go and tidy things up. He'll sit and rest a bit, and it will pass! [<i>Exit</i>].</p>
			<p>
				<i>Nikíta sits with his face in his hands. Mítritch and Nan seem stunned.</i>
			</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> It's whining! It's whining! It is really—there, there, quite plain! She'll bury it, really she will! [<i>Runs to the door</i>] Mother, don't bury it, it's alive.…</p>
			<p>
				<i>Enter Matryóna.</i>
			</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> [<i>whispers</i>] Now then, what is it? Heaven help you! Why won't you get to rest? How can it be alive? All its bones are crushed!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Give me more drink! [<i>Drinks</i>].</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Now go, sonnie. You'll fall asleep now all right.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>stands listening</i>] Still alive … there … it's whining! Don't you hear?… There!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> [<i>whispers</i>] No! I tell you!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Mother! My own mother! I've ruined my life! What have you done with me? Where am I to go? [<i>Runs out of the hut; Matryóna follows him</i>].</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Daddy dear, darling, they've smothered it!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH</span> [<i>angrily</i>] Go to sleep, I tell you! Oh dear, may the frogs kick you! I'll give it to you with the broom! Go to sleep, I tell you!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Daddy, my treasure! Something is catching hold of my shoulders, something is catching hold with its paws! Daddy dear … really, really … I must go! Daddy, darling! let me get up on the oven with you! Let me, for Heaven's sake! Catching hold … catching hold! Oh! [<i>Runs to the stove</i>].</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> See how they've frightened the girl.… What vile creatures they are! May the frogs kick them! Well then, climb up.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN</span> [<i>climbs on oven</i>] But don't you go away!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Where should I go to? Climb up, climb up! Oh Lord! Gracious Nicholas! Holy Mother!… How they have frighted the girl. [<i>Covers her up</i>] There's a little fool—really a little fool! How they've frighted her; really, they are vile creatures! The deuce take 'em!</p>
