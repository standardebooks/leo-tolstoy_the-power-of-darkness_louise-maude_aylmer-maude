			<h2>ACT III</h2>
			<p class="scene">The same hut. Winter. Nine months have passed since <a href="#act2">Act II</a>. Anísya, plainly dressed, sits before a loom weaving. Nan is on the oven.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH</span> [<i>an old labourer, enters, and slowly takes off his outdoor things</i>] Oh Lord, have mercy! Well, hasn’t the master come home yet?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> What?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Nikíta isn’t back from town, is he?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> No.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Must have been on the spree. Oh Lord!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Have you finished in the stackyard?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> What d’you think? Got it all as it should be, and covered everything with straw! I don’t like doing things by halves! Oh Lord! holy Nicholas! [<i>Picks at the corns on his hands</i>] But it’s time he was back.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> What need has he to hurry? He’s got money. Merry-making with that girl, I daresay⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Why shouldn’t one make merry if one has the money? And why did Akoulína go to town?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> You’d better ask her. How do I know what the devil took her there!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> What! to town? There’s all sorts of things to be got in town if one’s got the means. Oh Lord!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Mother, I heard myself. “I’ll get you a little shawl,” he says, blest if he didn’t; “you shall choose it yourself,” he says. And she got herself up so fine; she put on her velveteen coat and the French shawl.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Really, a girl’s modesty reaches only to the door. Step over the threshold and it’s forgotten. She is a shameless creature.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Oh my! What’s the use of being ashamed? While there’s plenty of money make merry. Oh Lord! It is too soon to have supper, eh? [<i>Anísya does not answer</i>] I’ll go and get warm meanwhile. [<i>Climbs on the stove</i>] Oh Lord! Blessed Virgin Mother! holy Nicholas!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR</span> [<i>enters</i>] Seems your goodman’s not back yet?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> No.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> It’s time he was. Hasn’t he perhaps stopped at our inn? My sister, Thekla, says there’s heaps of sledges standing there as have come from the town.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Nan! Nan, I say!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Yes?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> You run to the inn and see! Mayhap, being drunk, he’s gone there.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN</span> [<i>jumps down from the oven and dresses</i>] All right.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> And he’s taken Akoulína with him?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Else he’d not have had any need of going. It’s because of her he’s unearthed all the business there. “Must go to the bank,” he says; “it’s time to receive the payments,” he says. But it’s all her fooling.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR</span> [<i>shakes her head</i>] It’s a bad look-out. [<i>Silence</i>].</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN</span> [<i>at the door</i>] And if he’s there, what am I to say?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> You only see if he’s there.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> All right. I’ll be back in a winking. [<i>Long silence</i>].</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH</span> [<i>roars</i>] Oh Lord! merciful Nicholas!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR</span> [<i>starting</i>] Oh, how he scared me? Who is it?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Why, Mítritch, our labourer.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> Oh dear, oh dear, what a fright he did give me! I had quite forgotten. But tell me, dear, I’ve heard someone’s been wooing Akoulína?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>gets up from the loom and sits down by the table</i>] There was some one from Dédlovo; but it seems the affair’s got wind there too. They made a start, and then stopped; so the thing fell through. Of course, who’d care to?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> And the Lizounófs from Zoúevo?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> They made some steps too, but it didn’t come off either. They won’t even see us.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> Yet it’s time she was married.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Time and more than time! Ah, my dear, I’m that impatient to get her out of the house; but the matter does not come off. He does not wish it, nor she either. He’s not yet had enough of his beauty, you see.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> Eh, eh, eh, what doings! Only think of it. Why, he’s her step-father!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Ah, friend, they’ve taken me in completely. They’ve done me so fine it’s beyond saying. I, fool that I was, noticed nothing, suspected nothing, and so I married him. I guessed nothing, but they already understood one another.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> Oh dear, what goings on!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> So it went on from bad to worse, and I see they begin hiding from me. Ah, friend, I was that sick⁠—that sick of my life! It’s not as if I didn’t love him.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> That goes without saying.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Ah, how hard it is to bear such treatment from him! Oh, how it hurts!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> Yes, and I’ve heard say he’s becoming too free with his fists?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> And that too! There was a time when he was gentle when he’d had a drop. He used to hit out before, but of me he was always fond! But now when he’s in a temper he goes for me and is ready to trample me under his feet. The other day he got both hands entangled in my hair so that I could hardly get away. And the girl’s worse than a serpent; it’s a wonder the earth bears such furies.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> Ah, ah, my dear, now I look at you, you are a sufferer! To suffer like that is no joke. To have given shelter to a beggar, and he to lead you such a dance! Why don’t you pull in the reins?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Ah, but my dear, if it weren’t for my heart! Him as is gone was stern enough, still I could twist him about any way I liked; but with this one I can do nothing. As soon as I see him all my anger goes. I haven’t a grain of courage before him; I go about like a drowned hen.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> Ah, neighbour, you must be under a spell. I’ve heard that Matryóna goes in for that sort of thing. It must be her.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Yes, dear; I think so myself sometimes. Gracious me, how hurt I feel at times! I’d like to tear him to pieces. But when I set eyes on him, my heart won’t go against him.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> It’s plain you’re bewitched. It don’t take long to blight a body. There now, when I look at you, what you have dwindled to!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Growing a regular spindle-shanks. And just look at that fool Akoulína. Wasn’t the girl a regular untidy slattern, and just look at her now! Where has it all come from? Yes, he has fitted her out. She’s grown so smart, so puffed up, just like a bubble that’s ready to burst. And, though she’s a fool, she’s got it into her head, “I’m the mistress,” she says; “the house is mine; it’s me father wanted him to marry.” And she’s that vicious! Lord help us, when she gets into a rage she’s ready to tear the thatch off the house.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> Oh dear, what a life yours is, now I come to look at you. And yet there’s people envying you: “They’re rich,” they say; but it seems that gold don’t keep tears from falling.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Much reason for envy indeed! And the riches, too, will soon be made ducks and drakes of. Dear me, how he squanders money!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> But how’s it, dear, you’ve been so simple to give up the money? It’s yours.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Ah, if you knew all! The thing is that I’ve made one little mistake.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> Well, if I were you, I’d go straight and have the law of him. The money’s yours; how dare he squander it? There’s no such rights.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> They don’t pay heed to that nowadays.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> Ah, my dear, now I come to look at you, you’ve got that weak.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Yes, quite weak, dear, quite weak. He’s got me into a regular fix. I don’t myself know anything. Oh, my poor head!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR</span> [<i>listening</i>] There’s someone coming, I think. [<i>The door opens and Akím enters</i>].</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM</span> [<i>crosses himself, knocks the snow off his feet, and takes off his coat</i>] Peace be to this house! How do you do? Are you well, daughter?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> How d’you do, father? Do you come straight from home?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> I’ve been a-thinking, I’ll go and see what’s name, go to see my son, I mean⁠—my son. I didn’t start early⁠—had my dinner, I mean; I went, and it’s so what d’you call it⁠—so snowy, hard walking, and so there I’m what d’you call it⁠—late, I mean. And my son⁠—is he at home? At home? My son, I mean.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> No; he’s gone to the town.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM</span> [<i>sits down on a bench</i>] I’ve some business with him, d’you see, some business, I mean. I told him t’other day, told him I was in need⁠—told him, I mean, that our horse was done for, our horse, you see. So we must what d’ye call it, get a horse, I mean, some kind of a horse, I mean. So there, I’ve come, you see.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Nikíta told me. When he comes back you’ll have a talk. [<i>Goes to the oven</i>] Have some supper now, and he’ll soon come. Mítritch, eh Mítritch, come have your supper.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Oh Lord! merciful Nicholas!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Come to supper.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> I shall go now. Good-night. [<i>Exit</i>].</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH</span> [<i>gets down from the oven</i>] I never noticed how I fell asleep. Oh Lord! gracious Nicholas! How d’you do, Daddy Akím?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> Ah, Mítritch! What are you, what d’ye call it, I mean?⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Why, I’m working for your son, Nikíta.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> Dear me! What d’ye call⁠ ⁠… working for my son, I mean. Dear me!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> I was living with a tradesman in town, but drank all I had there. Now I’ve come back to the village. I’ve no home, so I’ve gone into service. [<i>Gapes</i>] Oh Lord!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> But how’s that, what d’you call it, or what’s name, Nikíta, what does he do? Has he some business, I mean besides, that he should hire a labourer, a labourer I mean, hire a labourer?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> What business should he have? He used to manage, but now he’s other things on his mind, so he’s hired a labourer.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Why shouldn’t he, seeing he has money?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> Now that’s what d’you call it, that’s wrong, I mean, quite wrong, I mean. That’s spoiling oneself.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Oh, he has got spoilt, that spoilt, it’s just awful.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> There now, what d’you call it, one thinks how to make things better, and it gets worse I mean. Riches spoil a man, spoil, I mean.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Fatness makes even a dog go mad; how’s one not to get spoilt by fat living? Myself now; how I went on with fat living. I drank for three weeks without being sober. I drank my last breeches. When I had nothing left, I gave it up. Now I’ve determined not to. Bother it!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> And where’s what d’you call, your old woman?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> My old woman has found her right place, old fellow. She’s hanging about the gin-shops in town. She’s a swell too; one eye knocked out, and the other black, and her muzzle twisted to one side. And she’s never sober; drat her!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> Oh, oh, oh, how’s that?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> And where’s a soldier’s wife to go? She has found her right place. [<i>Silence</i>].</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM</span> [<i>to Anísya</i>] And Nikíta⁠—has he what d’you call it, taken anything up to town? I mean, anything to sell?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>laying the table and serving up</i>] No, he’s taken nothing. He’s gone to get money from the bank.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM</span> [<i>sitting down to supper</i>] Why? D’you wish to put it to another use, the money I mean?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> No, we don’t touch it. Only some twenty or thirty roubles as have come due; they must be taken.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> Must be taken. Why take it, the money I mean? You’ll take some to-day I mean, and some to-morrow; and so you’ll what d’you call it, take it all, I mean.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> We get this besides. The money is all safe.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> All safe? How’s that, safe? You take it, and it what d’you call it, it’s all safe. How’s that? You put a heap of meal into a bin, or a barn, I mean, and go on taking meal, will it remain there what d’you call it, all safe I mean? That’s, what d’you call it, it’s cheating. You’d better find out, or else they’ll cheat you. Safe indeed! I mean you what d’ye call⁠ ⁠… you take it and it remains all safe there?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> I know nothing about it. Iván Moséitch advised us at the time. “Put the money in the bank,” he said, “the money will be safe, and you’ll get interest,” he said.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH</span> [<i>having finished his supper</i>] That’s so. I’ve lived with a tradesman. They all do like that. Put the money in the bank, then lie down on the oven and it will keep coming in.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> That’s queer talk. How’s that⁠—what d’ye call, coming in, how’s that coming in, and they, who do they get it from I mean, the money I mean?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> They take the money out of the bank.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Get along! ’Tain’t a thing a woman can understand! You look here, I’ll make it all clear to you. Mind and remember. You see, suppose you’ve got some money, and I, for instance, have spring coming on, my land’s idle, I’ve got no seeds, or I have to pay taxes. So, you see, I go to you. “Akím,” I say, “give us a ten-rouble note, and when I’ve harvested in autumn I’ll return it, and till two acres for you besides, for having obliged me!” And you, seeing I’ve something to fall back on⁠—a horse say, or a cow⁠—you say, “No, give two or three roubles for the obligation,” and there’s an end of it. I’m stuck in the mud, and can’t do without. So I say, “All right!” and take a tenner. In the autumn, when I’ve made my turnover, I bring it back, and you squeeze the extra three roubles out of me.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> Yes, but that’s what peasants do when they what d’ye call it, when they forget God. It’s not honest, I mean, it’s no good, I mean.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> You wait. You’ll see it comes just to the same thing. Now don’t forget how you’ve skinned me. And Anísya, say, has got some money lying idle. She does not know what to do with it, besides, she’s a woman, and does not know how to use it. She comes to you. “Couldn’t you make some profit with my money too?” she says. “Why not?” say you, and you wait. Before the summer I come again and say, “Give me another tenner, and I’ll be obliged.” Then you find out if my hide isn’t all gone, and if I can be skinned again you give me Anísya’s money. But supposing I’m clean shorn⁠—have nothing to eat⁠—then you see I can’t be fleeced any more, and you say, “Go your way, friend,” and you look out for another, and lend him your own and Anísya’s money and skin him. That’s what the bank is. So it goes round and round. It’s a cute thing, old fellow!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM</span> [<i>excitedly</i>] Gracious me, whatever is that like? It’s what d’ye call it, it’s filthy! The peasants⁠—what d’ye call it, the peasants do so I mean, and know it’s, what d’ye call it, a sin! It’s what d’you call, not right, not right, I mean. It’s filthy! How can people as have learnt⁠ ⁠… what d’ye call it⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> That, old fellow, is just what they’re fond of! And remember, them that are stupid, or the women folk, as can’t put their money into use themselves, they take it to the bank, and they there, deuce take ’em, clutch hold of it, and with this money they fleece the people. It’s a cute thing!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM</span> [<i>sighing</i>] Oh dear, I see, what d’ye call it, without money it’s bad, and with money it’s worse! How’s that? God told us to work, but you, what d’ye call⁠ ⁠… I mean you put money into the bank and go to sleep, and the money will what d’ye call it, will feed you while you sleep. It’s filthy, that’s what I call it; it’s not right.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Not right? Eh, old fellow, who cares about that nowadays? And how clean they pluck you, too! That’s the fact of the matter.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM</span> [<i>sighs</i>] Ah yes, seems the time’s what d’ye call it, the time’s growing ripe. There, I’ve had a look at the closets in town. What they’ve come to! It’s all polished and polished I mean, it’s fine, it’s what d’ye call it, it’s like inside an inn. And what’s it all for? What’s the good of it? Oh, they’ve forgotten God. Forgotten, I mean. We’ve forgotten, forgotten God, God I mean! Thank you, my dear, I’ve had enough. I’m quite satisfied. [<i>Rises. Mítritch climbs on to the oven</i>].</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>eats, and collects the dishes</i>] If his father would only take him to task! But I’m ashamed to tell him.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> What d’you say?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Oh! it’s nothing.</p>
			<p>
				<i>Enter Nan.</i>
			</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> Here’s a good girl, always busy! You’re cold, I should think?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Yes, I am, terribly. How d’you do, grandfather?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Well? Is he there?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> No. But Andriyán is there. He’s been to town, and he says he saw them at an inn in town. He says Dad’s as drunk as drunk can be!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Do you want anything to eat? Here you are.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN</span> [<i>goes to the oven</i>] Well, it <em>is</em> cold. My hands are quite numb. [<i>Akím takes off his leg-bands and bast-shoes. Anísya washes up</i>].</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Father!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> Well, what is it?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> And is Marína living well?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> Yes, she’s living all right. The little woman is what d’ye call it, clever and steady; she’s living, and what d’ye call it, doing her best. She’s all right; the little woman’s of the right sort I mean; painstaking and what d’ye call it, submissive; the little woman’s all right I mean, all right, you know.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> And is there no talk in your village that a relative of Marína’s husband thinks of marrying our Akoulína? Have you heard nothing of it?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> Ah; that’s Mirónof. Yes, the women did chatter something. But I didn’t pay heed, you know. It don’t interest me I mean, I don’t know anything. Yes, the old women did say something, but I’ve a bad memory, bad memory, I mean. But the Mirónofs are what d’ye call it, they’re all right, I mean they’re all right.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> I’m that impatient to get her settled.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> And why?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN</span> [<i>listens</i>] They’ve come!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Well, don’t you go bothering them. [<i>Goes on washing the spoons without turning her head</i>].</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>enters</i>] Anísya! Wife! who has come? [<i>Anísya looks up and turns away in silence</i>].</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>severely</i>] Who has come? Have you forgotten?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Now don’t humbug. Come in!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>still more severely</i>] Who’s come?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>goes up and takes him by the arm</i>] Well then, husband has come. Now then, come in!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>holds back</i>] Ah, that’s it! Husband! And what’s husband called? Speak properly.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Oh bother you! Nikíta!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Where have you learnt manners? The full name.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Nikíta Akímitch! Now then!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>still in the doorway</i>] Ah, that’s it! But now⁠—the surname?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>laughs and pulls him by the arm</i>] Tchilíkin. Dear me, what airs!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Ah, that’s it. [<i>Holds on to the door-post</i>] No, now say with which foot Tchilíkin steps into this house!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> That’s enough! You’re letting the cold in!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Say with which foot he steps? You’ve got to say it⁠—that’s flat.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>aside</i>] He’ll go on worrying. [<i>To Nikíta</i>] Well then, with the left. Come in!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Ah, that’s it.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> You look who’s in the hut!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Ah, my parent! Well, what of that? I’m not ashamed of my parent. I can pay my respects to my parent. How d’you do, father? [<i>Bows and puts out his hand</i>] My respects to you.</p>

			<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM</span> [<i>does not answer</i>] Drink, I mean drink, what it does! It’s filthy!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Drink, what’s that? I’ve been drinking? I’m to blame, that’s flat! I’ve had a glass with a friend, drank his health.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Go and lie down, I say.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Wife, say where am I standing?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Now then, it’s all right, lie down!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> No, I’ll first drink a samovár with my parent. Go and light the samovár. Akoulína, I say, come here!</p>
			<p>
				<i>Enter Akoulína, smartly dressed and carrying their purchases.</i>
			</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> Why have you thrown everything about? Where’s the yarn?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> The yarn? The yarn’s there. Hullo, Mítritch, where are you? Asleep? Asleep? Go and put the horse up.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM</span> [<i>not seeing Akoulína but looking at his son</i>] Dear me, what is he doing? The old man’s what d’ye call it, quite done up, I mean⁠—been thrashing⁠—and look at him, what d’ye call it, putting on airs! Put up the horse! Faugh, what filth!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH</span> [<i>climbs down from the oven, and puts on felt boots</i>] Oh, merciful Lord! Is the horse in the yard? Done it to death, I dare say. Just see how he’s been swilling, the deuce take him. Up to his very throat. Oh Lord, holy Nicholas! [<i>Puts on sheepskin, and exit</i>].</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>sits down</i>] You must forgive me, father. It’s true I’ve had a drop; well, what of that? Even a hen will drink. Ain’t it true? So you must forgive me. Never mind Mítritch, he doesn’t mind, he’ll put it up.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Shall I really light the samovár?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Light it! My parent has come. I wish to talk to him, and shall drink tea with him. [<i>To Akoulína</i>] Have you brought all the parcels?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> The parcels? I’ve brought mine, the rest’s in the sledge. Hi, take this, this isn’t mine!</p>
			<p>
				<i>Throws a parcel on the table and puts the others into her box. Nan watches her while she puts them away. Akím does not look at his son, but puts his leg-bands and bast-shoes on the oven.</i>

			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>pretending to be sober</i>] You must not be cross with me, father. You think I’m drunk? I am all there, that’s flat! As they say, “Drink, but keep your wits about you.” I can talk with you at once, father. I can attend to any business. You told me about the money; your horse is worn-out⁠—I remember! That can all be managed. That’s all in our hands. If it was an enormous sum that’s wanted, then we might wait; but as it is I can do everything. That’s the case.</p>

			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> The money, here it is. [<i>Puts his hand in his pocket, pulls out pocket-book, handles the notes in it and takes out a ten-rouble note</i>] Take this to get a horse; I can’t forget my parent. I shan’t forsake him, that’s flat. Because he’s my parent! Here you are, take it! Really now, I don’t grudge it. [<i>Comes up and pushes the note towards Akím who won’t take it.

			<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> I can’t, what d’you call it, I mean, can’t take it! And can’t what d’ye call it, talk to you, because you’re not yourself, I mean.</p>

			<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM</span> [<i>takes it, and shakes his head</i>] Oh! that liquor. Not like a man, I mean!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> That’s better! If you repay it you’ll repay it, if not I’ll make no bother. That’s what I am! [<i>Sees Akoulína</i>] Akoulína, show your presents.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> What?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Show your presents.</p>

			<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> Oh, oh! It’s sickening! [<i>Climbs on the oven</i>].</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA</span> [<i>gets out the parcels and puts them on the table</i>] Well, there you are⁠—what’s the good of looking at ’em?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Oh how lovely! It’s as good as Stepanída’s.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> Stepanída’s? What’s Stepanída’s compared to this? [<i>Brightening up and undoing the parcels</i>] Just look here⁠—see the quality! It’s a French one.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> The print <em>is</em> fine! Mary has a dress like it, only lighter on a blue ground. This <em>is</em> pretty.</p>

				<i>Anísya passes angrily into the closet, returns with a tablecloth and the chimney of the samovár, and goes up to the table.</i>

			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> You think I have forgotten you? Look here! [<i>Shows her a parcel and sits down on it</i>] It’s a present for you. Only you must earn it! Wife, where am I sitting?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Enough of your humbug. I’m not afraid of you. Whose money are you spreeing on and buying your fat wench presents with? Mine!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> Yours indeed? No fear! You wished to steal it, but it did not come off! Get out of the way! [<i>Pushes her while trying to pass</i>].</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> What are you shoving for? I’ll teach you to shove!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> Shove me? You try! [<i>Presses against Anísya</i>].</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Now then, now then, you women. Have done now! [<i>Steps between them</i>].</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> Comes shoving herself in! You ought to keep quiet and remember your doings! You think no one knows!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Knows what? Out with it, out with it! What do they know?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> I know something about you!</p>

			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>turns Anísya round and pushes her out</i>] Be off!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Where am I to go? I’ll not go out of my own house!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Be off, I tell you, and don’t dare to come in here!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> I won’t go! [<i>Nikíta pushes her, Anísya cries and screams and clings to the door</i>] What! am I to be turned out of my own house by the scruff of the neck? What are you doing, you scoundrel? Do you think there’s no law for you? You wait a bit!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Now then!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> I’ll go to the Elder! To the policeman!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Off, I tell you! [<i>Pushes her out</i>].</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>behind the door</i>] I’ll hang myself!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> No fear!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Oh, oh, oh! Mother, dear, darling! [<i>Cries</i>].</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Me frightened of her! A likely thing! What are you crying for? She’ll come back, no fear. Go and see to the samovár. [<i>Exit Nan</i>].</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA</span> [<i>collects and folds her presents</i>] The mean wretch, how she’s messed it up. But wait a bit, I’ll cut up her jacket for her! Sure I will!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> I’ve turned her out, what more do you want?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> She’s dirtied my new shawl. If that bitch hadn’t gone away, I’d have torn her eyes out!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> That’s enough. Why should you be angry? Now if I loved her⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> Loved her? She’s worth loving, with her fat mug! If you’d have given her up, then nothing would have happened. You should have sent her to the devil. And the house was mine all the same, and the money was mine! Says she is the mistress, but what sort of mistress is she to her husband? She’s a murderess, that’s what she is! She’ll serve you the same way!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Oh dear, how’s one to stop a woman’s jaw? You don’t yourself know what you’re jabbering about!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> Yes, I do. I’ll not live with her! I’ll turn her out of the house! She can’t live here with me. The mistress indeed! She’s not the mistress⁠—that jailbird!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> That’s enough! What have you to do with her? Don’t mind her. You look at me! I am the master! I do as I like. I’ve ceased to love her, and now I love you. I love who I like! The power is mine, she’s under me. That’s where I keep her. [<i>Points to his feet</i>] A pity we’ve no concertina. [<i>Sings</i>].</p>

			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>unpacks spirits, rusks, and salt herrings</i>] That’s for myself. This is yarn for the wife.

[<i>Adds</i>] Wheat-flour, 80 kopéykas, oil⁠ ⁠… Father, 10 roubles.⁠ ⁠… Father, come let’s have some tea!</p>

Don’t be cross, sit down and drink this. [<i>Fills a wine-glass for her</i>] And here’s your present. [<i>Gives her the parcel he had been sitting on.

			<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM</span> [<i>fastens his belt</i>] Going, because, I mean, it’s not right in your house, I mean, what d’you call it, not right, Nikíta, in the house, what d’ye call it, not right! I mean, you are living a bad life, Nikíta, bad⁠—I’ll go.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Eh now! Have done talking! Sit down and drink your tea!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Why, father, you’ll shame us before the neighbours. What has offended you?</p>

			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Sit down and drink your tea, and have done with it!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> I can’t, I mean can’t what d’ye call it, can’t drink tea. Because of your filth, I mean; I feel what d’ye call it, I feel sick, very sick! I can’t what d’ye call it, I can’t drink tea with you.</p>

			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Now really, what right have you to reprove me in my own house? Why do you keep on at me? Am I a child that you can pull by the hair? Nowadays those things have been dropped!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> That’s true. I have heard that nowadays, what d’ye call it, that nowadays children pull their fathers’ beards, I mean! But that’s ruin, that’s ruin, I mean!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>angrily</i>] We are living without help from you, and it’s you who came to us with your wants!</p>
