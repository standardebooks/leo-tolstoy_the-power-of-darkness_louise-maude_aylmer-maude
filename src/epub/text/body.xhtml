<h2><a name="act1" id="act1">ACT I</a></h2>

<p class="scene">The Act takes place in autumn in a large village. The
Scene represents Peter's roomy hut. Peter is sitting on a wooden
bench, mending a horse-collar. Anísya and Akoulína are
spinning, and singing a part-song.</p>


<p><span class="speaker">PETER</span> [<i>looking out of the window</i>] The horses have
got loose again. If we don't look out they'll be killing
the colt. Nikíta! Hey, Nikíta! Is the fellow deaf?
[<i>Listens. To the women</i>] Shut up, one can't hear anything.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>from outside</i>] What?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Drive the horses in.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span>. We'll drive 'em in. All in good time.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER</span> [<i>shaking his head</i>] Ah, these labourers! If I
were well, I'd not keep one on no account. There's
nothing but bother with 'em. [<i>Rises and sits down again</i>]
Nikíta!… It's no good shouting. One of you'd better
go. Go, Akoúl, drive 'em in.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> What? The horses?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> What else?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> All right. [<i>Exit</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Ah, but he's a loafer, that lad … no good at
all. Won't stir a finger if he can help it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> You're so mighty brisk yourself. When you're
not sprawling on the top of the oven you're squatting on
the bench. To goad others to work is all you're fit for.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> If one weren't to goad you on a bit, one'd
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>have no roof left over one's head before the year's out.
Oh what people!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> You go shoving a dozen jobs on to one's
shoulders, and then do nothing but scold. It's easy to
lie on the oven and give orders.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER</span> [<i>sighing</i>] Oh, if 'twere not for this sickness that's
got hold of me, I'd not keep him on another day.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA</span> [<i>off the scene</i>] Gee up, gee, woo. [<i>A colt
neighs, the stamping of horses' feet and the creaking of the gate
are heard</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Bragging, that's what he's good at. I'd like to
sack him, I would indeed.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>mimicking him</i>] “Like to sack him.” You buckle
to yourself, and then talk.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA</span> [<i>enters</i>] It's all I could do to drive 'em in.
That piebald always will …</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> And where's Nikíta?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> Where's Nikíta? Why, standing out there
in the street.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> What's he standing there for?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> What's he standing there for? He stands
there jabbering.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> One can't get any sense out of her! Who's he
jabbering with?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA</span> [<i>does not hear</i>] Eh, what?</p>

<p><i>Peter waves her off. She sits down to her spinning.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN</span> [<i>running in to her mother</i>] Nikíta's father and
mother have come. They're going to take him away.
It's true!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Nonsense!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Yes. Blest if they're not! [<i>Laughing</i>] I was
just going by, and Nikíta, he says, “Good-bye, Anna
Petróvna,” he says, “you must come and dance at my
wedding. I'm leaving you,” he says, and laughs.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>to her husband</i>] There now. Much he cares. You
see, he wants to leave of himself. “Sack him” indeed!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
<span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Well, let him go. Just as if I couldn't find
somebody else.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> And what about the money he's had in advance?</p>

<p><i>Nan stands listening at the door for awhile, and then exit.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER</span> [<i>frowning</i>] The money? Well, he can work it
off in summer, anyhow.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Well, of course you'll be glad if he goes and
you've not got to feed him. It's only me as'll have to
work like a horse all the winter. That lass of yours
isn't over fond of work either. And you'll be lying up on
the oven. I know you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> What's the good of wearing out one's tongue
before one has the hang of the matter?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> The yard's full of cattle. You've not sold the
cow, and have kept all the sheep for the winter: feeding
and watering 'em alone takes all one's time, and you
want to sack the labourer. But I tell you straight, I'm not
going to do a man's work! I'll go and lie on the top of
the oven same as you, and let everything go to pot!
You may do what you like.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER</span> [<i>to Akoulína</i>] Go and see about the feeding,
will you? it's time.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> The feeding? All right. [<i>Puts on a coat
and takes a rope</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> I'm not going to work for you. You go and
work yourself. I've had enough of it, so there!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> That'll do. What are you raving about? Like
a sheep with the staggers!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> You're a crazy cur, you are! One gets neither
work nor pleasure from you. Eating your fill, that's all
you do, you palsied cur, you!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER</span> [<i>spits and puts on coat</i>] Faugh! The Lord have
mercy! I'd better go myself and see what's up. [<i>Exit</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>after him</i>] Scurvy long-nosed devil!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> What are you swearing at dad for?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
<span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Hold your noise, you idiot!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA</span> [<i>going to the door</i>] I know why you're swearing
at him. You're an idiot yourself, you bitch. I'm not
afraid of you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> What do you mean? [<i>Jumps up and looks round
for something to hit her with</i>] Mind, or I'll give you one
with the poker.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA</span> [<i>opening the door</i>] Bitch! devil! that's what
you are! Devil! bitch! bitch! devil! [<i>Runs off</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>ponders</i>] “Come and dance at my wedding!”
What new plan is this? Marry? Mind, Nikíta, if that's
your intention, I'll go and … No, I can't live without
him. I won't let him go.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>enters, looks round, and seeing Anísya alone
approaches quickly. In a low tone</i>] Here's a go; I'm in a
regular fix! That governor of mine wants to take me
away,—tells me I'm to come home. Says quite straight
I'm to marry and live at home.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Well, go and marry! What's that to me?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Is that it? Why, here am I reckoning how
best to consider matters, and just hear her! She tells
me to go and marry. Why's that? [<i>Winking</i>] Has she
forgotten?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Yes, go and marry! What do I care?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> What are you spitting for? Just see, she won't
even let me stroke her.… What's the matter?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> This! That you want to play me false.… If
you do,—why, I don't want you either. So now you know!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> That'll do, Anísya. Do you think I'll forget
you? Never while I live! I'll not play you false, that's
flat. I've been thinking that supposing they do go and
make me marry, I'd still come back to you. If only he
don't make me live at home.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Much need I'll have of you, once you're married.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> There's a go now. How is it possible to go
against one's father's will?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
<span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Yes, I daresay, shove it all on your father.
You know it's your own doing. You've long been plotting
with that slut of yours, Marína. It's she has put you up
to it. She didn't come here for nothing t'other day.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Marína? What's she to me? Much I care
about her!… Plenty of them buzzing around.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Then what has made your father come here?
It's you have told him to. You've gone and deceived me.
[<i>Cries</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Anísya, do you believe in a God or not? I
never so much as dreamt of it. I know nothing at all
about it. I never even dreamt of it—that's flat! My old
dad has got it all out of his own pate.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> If you don't wish it yourself who can force you?
He can't drive you like an ass.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Well, I reckon it's not possible to go against
one's parent. But it's not by my wish.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Don't you budge, that's all about it!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> There was a fellow wouldn't budge, and the
village elder gave him such a hiding.… That's what
it might come to! I've no great wish for that sort of
thing. They say it touches one up.…</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Shut up with your nonsense. Nikíta, listen to
me: if you marry that Marína I don't know what I won't
do to myself.… I shall lay hands on myself! I have
sinned, I have gone against the law, but I can't go back
now. If you go away I'll …</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Why should I go? Had I wanted to go—I
should have gone long ago. There was Iván Semyónitch
t'other day—offered me a place as his coachman.…
Only fancy what a life that would have been!
But I did not go. Because, I reckon, I am good enough
for any one. Now if you did not love me it would be a
different matter.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Yes, and that's what you should remember.
My old man will die one of these fine days, I'm thinking;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>then we could cover our sin, make it all right and lawful,
and then you'll be master here.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Where's the good of making plans? What do
I care? I work as hard as if I were doing it for myself.
My master loves me, and his missus loves me. And if
the wenches run after me, it's not my fault, that's flat.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> And you'll love me?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>embracing her</i>] There, as you have ever been
in my heart …</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> [<i>enters, and crosses herself a long time before the
icón. Nikíta and Anísya step apart</i>] What I saw I didn't
perceive, what I heard I didn't hearken to. Playing with
the lass, eh? Well,—even a calf will play. Why shouldn't
one have some fun when one's young? But your master
is out in the yard a-calling you, sonnie.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> I only came to get the axe.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> I know, sonnie, I know; them sort of axes
are mostly to be found where the women are.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>stooping to pick up axe</i>] I say, mother, is it true
you want me to marry? As I reckon, that's quite unnecessary.
Besides, I've got no wish that way.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Eh, honey! why should you marry? Go on
as you are. It's all the old man. You'd better go, sonnie,
we can talk these matters over without you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> It's a queer go! One moment I'm to be married,
the next, not. I can't make head or tail of it. [<i>Exit</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> What's it all about then? Do you really wish
him to get married?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Eh, why should he marry, my jewel? It's
all nonsense, all my old man's drivel. “Marry, marry.”
But he's reckoning without his host. You know the
saying, “From oats and hay, why should horses stray?”
When you've enough and to spare, why look elsewhere?
And so in this case. [<i>Winks</i>] Don't I see which way the
wind blows?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Where's the good of my pretending to you,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>Mother Matryóna? You know all about it. I have
sinned. I love your son.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Dear me, here's news! D'you think Mother
Matryóna didn't know? Eh, lassie,—Mother Matryóna's
been ground, and ground again, ground fine! This much
I can tell you, my jewel: Mother Matryóna can see
through a brick wall three feet thick. I know it all, my
jewel! I know what young wives need sleeping draughts
for, so I've brought some along. [<i>Unties a knot in her
handkerchief and brings out paper-packets</i>] As much as is
wanted, I see, and what's not wanted I neither see nor
perceive! There! Mother Matryóna has also been young.
I had to know a thing or two to live with my old fool. I
know seventy-and-seven dodges. But I see your old
man's quite seedy, quite seedy! How's one to live with
such as him? Why, if you pricked him with a hay-fork
it wouldn't fetch blood. See if you don't bury him before
the spring. Then you'll need some one in the house.
Well, what's wrong with my son? He'll do as well as
another. Then where's the advantage of my taking him
away from a good place? Am I my child's enemy?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Oh, if only he does not go away.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> He won't go away, birdie. It's all nonsense.
You know my old man. His wits are always
wool-gathering; yet sometimes he takes a thing into his
pate, and it's as if it were wedged in, you can't knock
it out with a hammer.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> And what started this business?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Well, you see, my jewel, you yourself know
what a fellow with women the lad is,—and he's handsome
too, though I say it as shouldn't. Well, you know, he
was living at the railway, and they had an orphan wench
there to cook for them. Well, that same wench took to
running after him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Marína?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Yes, the plague seize her! Whether anything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>happened or not, anyhow something got to my old
man's ears. Maybe he heard from the neighbours, maybe
she's been and blabbed …</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Well, she is a bold hussy!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> So my old man—the old blockhead—off he
goes: “Marry, marry,” he says, “he must marry her and
cover the sin,” he says. “We must take the lad home,”
he says, “and he shall marry,” he says. Well, I did my
best to make him change his mind, but, dear me, no.
So, all right, thinks I,—I'll try another dodge. One always
has to entice them fools in this way, just pretend to be
of their mind, and when it comes to the point one goes
and turns it all one's own way. You know, a woman has
time to think seventy-and-seven thoughts while falling
off the oven, so how's such as he to see through it?
“Well, yes,” says I, “it would be a good job,—only we
must consider well beforehand. Why not go and see our
son, and talk it over with Peter Ignátitch and hear what
he has to say?” So here we are.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Oh dear, oh dear, how will it all end? Supposing
his father just orders him to marry her?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Orders, indeed. Chuck his orders to the
dogs! Don't you worry; that affair will never come off.
I'll go to your old man myself, and sift and strain this
matter clear—there will be none of it left. I have come
here only for the look of the thing. A very likely thing!
Here's my son living in happiness and expecting happiness,
and I'll go and match him with a slut! No fear,
I'm not a fool!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> And she—this Marína—came dangling after him
here! Mother, would you believe, when they said he was
going to marry, it was as if a knife had gone right through
my heart. I thought he cared for her.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Oh, my jewel! Why, you don't think him
such a fool, that he should go and care for a homeless baggage
like that? Nikíta is a sensible fellow, you see. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>knows whom to love. So don't you go and fret, my
jewel. We'll not take him away, and we won't marry
him. No, we'll let him stay on, if you'll only oblige us
with a little money.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> All I know is, that I could not live if Nikíta
went away.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Naturally, when one's young it's no easy
matter! You, a wench in full bloom, to be living with the
dregs of a man like that husband of yours.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Mother Matryóna, would you believe it? I'm
that sick of him, that sick of this long-nosed cur of mine,
I can hardly bear to look at him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Yes, I see, it's one of them cases. Just
look here, [<i>looks round and whispers</i>] I've been to see that
old man, you know—he's given me simples of two kinds.
This, you see, is a sleeping draught. “Just give him one
of these powders,” he says, “and he'll sleep so sound you
might jump on him!” And this here, “This is that kind
of simple,” he says, “that if you give one some of it to
drink it has no smell whatever, but its strength is very
great. There are seven doses here, a pinch at a time.
Give him seven pinches,” he says, “and she won't have
far to look for freedom,” he says.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> O-o-oh! What's that?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> “No sign whatever,” he says. He's taken
a rouble for it. “Can't sell it for less,” he says. Because
it's no easy matter to get 'em, you know. I
paid him, dearie, out of my own money. If she takes
them, thinks I, it's all right; if she don't, I can let old
Michael's daughter have them.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> O-o-oh! But mayn't some evil come of them?
I'm frightened!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> What evil, my jewel? If your old man was
hale and hearty, 'twould be a different matter, but he's
neither alive nor dead as it is. He's not for this world.
Such things often happen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
<span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> O-o-oh, my poor head! I'm afeared, Mother
Matryóna, lest some evil come of them. No. That
won't do.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Just as you like. I might even return
them to him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> And are they to be used in the same way as
the others? Mixed in water?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Better in tea, he says. “You can't notice
anything,” he says, “no smell nor nothing.” He's a cute
old fellow too.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> All right. All right. Sit down and let's talk it
over. [<i>Akím sits down</i>] Well then, what's it all about?
You want him to marry?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> As to marrying, he might bide a while,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>Peter Ignátitch. You know our poverty, Peter Ignátitch.
What's he to marry on? We've hardly enough to eat
ourselves. How can he marry then?…</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> You must consider what will be best.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Where's the hurry for him to get married?
Marriage is not that sort of thing, it's not like ripe raspberries
that drop off if not picked in time.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> If he were to get married, 'twould be a good
thing in a way.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> We'd like to … what d'you call it? 'Cos why,
you see. I've what d'you call it … a job. I mean, I've
found a paying job in town, you know.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> And a fine job too—cleaning out cesspools.
The other day when he came home, I could do nothing
but spew and spew. Faugh!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> It's true, at first it does seem what d'you call it
… knocks one clean over, you know,—the smell, I
mean. But one gets used to it, and then it's nothing,
no worse than malt grain, and then it's, what d'you call it,
… pays, pays, I mean. And as to the smell being, what
d'you call it, it's not for the likes of us to complain. And
one changes one's clothes. So we'd like to take what's
his name … Nikíta I mean, home. Let him manage
things at home while I, what d'you call it,—earn something
in town.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> You want to keep your son at home? Yes, that
would be well: but how about the money he has had in
advance?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> That's it, that's it! It's just as you say, Ignátitch,
it's just what d'you call it. 'Cos why? If you go into
service, it's as good as if you had sold yourself, they say.
That will be all right. I mean he may stay and serve
his time, only he must, what d'you call it, get married.
I mean—so: you let him off for a little while, that he
may, what d'you call it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Yes, we could manage that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
<span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Ah, but it's not yet settled between ourselves,
Peter Ignátitch. I'll speak to you as I would
before God, and you may judge between my old man and
me. He goes on harping on that marriage. But just
ask—who it is he wants him to marry. If it were a girl
of the right sort now— I am not my child's enemy, but
the wench is not honest.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> No, that's wrong! Wrong, I say. 'Cos why?
She, that same girl—it's my son as has offended, offended
the girl I mean.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> How offended?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> That's how. She's what d'you call it, with him,
with my son, Nikíta. With Nikíta, what d'you call it, I
mean.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> You wait a bit, my tongue runs smoother—let
me tell it. You know, this lad of ours lived at the
railway before he came to you. There was a girl there as
kept dangling after him. A girl of no account, you know,
her name's Marína. She used to cook for the men. So
now this same girl accuses our son, Nikíta, that he, so to
say, deceived her.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Well, there's nothing good in that.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> But she's no honest girl herself; she runs
after the fellows like a common slut.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> There you are again, old woman, and it's not at
all what d'you call it, it's all not what d'you call it, I
mean …</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> There now, that's all the sense one gets
from my old owl—“what d'you call it, what d'you call
it,” and he doesn't know himself what he means. Peter
Ignátitch, don't listen to me, but go yourself and ask any
one you like about the girl, everybody will say the same.
She's just a homeless good-for-nothing.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> You know, Daddy Akím, if that's how things
are, there's no reason for him to marry her. A daughter-in-law's
not like a shoe, you can't kick her off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
<span class="speaker">AKÍM</span> [<i>excitedly</i>] It's false, old woman, it's what d'you
call it, false; I mean, about the girl; false! 'Cos why?
The lass is a good lass, a very good lass, you know. I'm
sorry, sorry for the lassie, I mean.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> It's an old saying: “For the wide world
old Miriam grieves, and at home without bread her
children she leaves.” He's sorry for the girl, but not
sorry for his own son! Sling her round your neck and
carry her about with you! That's enough of such empty
cackle!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> No, it's not empty.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> There, don't interrupt, let me have my say.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM</span> [<i>interrupts</i>] No, not empty! I mean, you twist
things your own way, about the lass or about <ins title="yourself">yourself.</ins>
Twist them, I mean, to make it better for yourself; but
God, what d'you call it, turns them His way. That's how
it is.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Eh! One only wears out one's tongue with
you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> The lass is hard-working and spruce, and keeps
everything round herself … what d'you call it. And
in our poverty, you know, it's a pair of hands, I mean;
and the wedding needn't cost much. But the chief
thing's the offence, the offence to the lass, and she's a what
d'you call it, an orphan, you know; that's what she is,
and there's the offence.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Eh! they'll all tell you a tale of that sort …</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Daddy Akím, you'd better listen to us women;
we can tell you a thing or two.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> And God, how about God? Isn't she a human
being, the lass? A what d'you call it,—also a human being
I mean, before God. And how do you look at it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Eh!… started off again?…</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Wait a bit, Daddy Akím. One can't believe all
these girls say, either. The lad's alive, and not far away;
send for him, and find out straight from him if it's true.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>He won't wish to lose his soul. Go and call the fellow,
[<i>Anísya rises</i>] and tell him his father wants him. [<i>Exit
Anísya</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> That's right, dear friend; you've cleared
the way clean, as with water. Yes, let the lad speak for
himself. Nowadays, you know, they'll not let you force a
son to marry; one must first of all ask the lad. He'll
never consent to marry her and disgrace himself, not for
all the world. To my thinking, it's best he should go on
living with you and serving you as his master. And we
need not take him home for the summer either; we can
hire a help. If you would only give us ten roubles now,
we'll let him stay on.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> All in good time. First let us settle one thing
before we start another.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> You see, Peter Ignátitch, I speak. 'Cos why?
you know how it happens. We try to fix things up as
seems best for ourselves, you know; and as to God, we
what d'you call it, we forget Him. We think it's best
so, turn it our own way, and lo! we've got into a fix, you
know. We think it will be best, I mean; and lo! it turns
out much worse—without God, I mean.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Of course one must not forget God.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> It turns out worse! But when it's the right
way—God's way—it what d'you call it, it gives one joy;
seems pleasant, I mean. So I reckon, you see, get him,
the lad, I mean, get him to marry her, to keep him from
sin, I mean, and let him what d'you call it at home,
as it's lawful, I mean, while I go and get the job in town.
The work is of the right sort—it's payin', I mean. And
in God's sight it's what d'you call it—it's best, I mean.
Ain't she an orphan? Here, for example, a year ago
some fellows went and took timber from the steward,—thought
they'd do the steward, you know. Yes, they
did the steward, but they couldn't what d'you call it—do
God, I mean. Well, and so …</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
<i>Enter Nikíta and Nan.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> You called me? [<i>Sits down and takes out his
tobacco-pouch</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER</span> [<i>in a low, reproachful voice</i>] What are you thinking
about—have you no manners? Your father is going
to speak to you, and you sit down and fool about with
tobacco. Come, get up!</p>

<p><i>Nikíta rises, leans carelessly with his elbow on the table, and
smiles.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> It seems there's a complaint, you know, about
you, Nikíta—a complaint, I mean, a complaint.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Who's been complaining?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> Complaining? It's a maid, an orphan maid, complaining,
I mean. It's her, you know—a complaint against
you, from Marína, I mean.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>laughs</i>] Well, that's a good one. What's the
complaint? And who's told you—she herself?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> It's I am asking you, and you must now, what
d'you call it, give me an answer. Have you got mixed
up with the lass, I mean—mixed up, you know?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> I don't know what you mean. What's up?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> Foolin', I mean, what d'you call it? foolin'.
Have you been foolin' with her, I mean?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Never mind what's been! Of course one does
have some fun with a cook now and then to while away
the time. One plays the concertina and gets her to
dance. What of that?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Don't shuffle, Nikíta, but answer your father
straight out.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM</span> [<i>solemnly</i>] You can hide it from men but not
from God, Nikíta. You, what d'you call it—think, I
mean, and don't tell lies. She's an orphan; so, you see,
any one is free to insult her. An orphan, you see. So
you should say what's rightest.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> But what if I have nothing to say? I have
told you everything—because there isn't anything to tell,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>that's flat! [<i>Getting excited</i>] She can go and say anything
about me, same as if she was speaking of one as is dead.
Why don't she say anything about Fédka Mikíshin? Besides,
how's this, that one mayn't even have a bit of fun
nowadays? And as for her, well, she's free to say anything
she likes.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> Ah, Nikíta, mind! A lie will out. Did anything
happen?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>aside</i>] How he sticks to it; it's too bad. [<i>To
Akím</i>] I tell you, I know nothing more. There's been
nothing between us. [<i>Angrily</i>] By God! and may I never
leave this spot [<i>crosses himself</i>] if I know anything about
it. [<i>Silence. Then still more excitedly</i>] Why! have you
been thinking of getting me to marry her? What do
you mean by it?—it's a confounded shame. Besides,
nowadays you've got no such rights as to force a fellow to
marry. That's plain enough. Besides, haven't I sworn I
know nothing about it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> [<i>to her husband</i>] There now, that's just like
your silly pate, to believe all they tell you. He's gone
and put the lad to shame all for nothing. The best thing
is to let him live as he is living, with his master. His
master will help us in our present need, and give us ten
roubles, and when the time comes …</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Well, Daddy Akím, how's it to be?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM</span> [<i>looks at his son, clicking his tongue disapprovingly</i>]
Mind, Nikíta, the tears of one that's been wronged
never, what d'you call it—never fall beside the mark but
always on, what's name—the head of the man as did the
wrong. So mind, don't what d'you call it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>sits down</i>] What's there to mind? mind yourself.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN</span> [<i>aside</i>] I must run and tell mother. [<i>Exit</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> [<i>to Peter</i>] That's always the way with this
old mumbler of mine, Peter Ignátitch. Once he's got
anything wedged in his pate there's no knocking it out.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>We've gone and troubled you all for nothing. The lad
can go on living as he has been. Keep him; he's your
servant.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Well, Daddy Akím, what do you say?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> Why, the lad's his own master, if only he what
d'you call it.… I only wish that, what d'you call it, I
mean.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> You don't know yourself what you're jawing
about. The lad himself has no wish to leave. Besides,
what do we want with him at home? We can manage
without him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Only one thing, Daddy Akím—if you are thinking
of taking him back in summer, I don't want him here
for the winter. If he is to stay at all, it must be for the
whole year.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> And it's for a year he'll bind himself. If
we want help when the press of work comes, we can hire
help, and the lad shall remain with you. Only give us
ten roubles now.…</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Well then, is it to be for another year?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> [<i>sighing</i>] Yes, it seems, it what d'you call it … if
it's so, I mean, it seems that it must be what d'you
call it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> For a year, counting from St. Dimítry's
day. We know you'll pay him fair wages. But give us
ten roubles now. Help us out of our difficulties. [<i>Gets
up and bows to Peter</i>].</p>

<p><i>Enter Nan and Anísya. The latter sits down at one side.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Well, if that's settled we might step across to
the inn and have a drink. Come, Daddy Akím, what do
you say to a glass of vódka?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> No, I never drink that sort of thing.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Well, you'll have some tea?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> Ah, tea! yes, I do sin that way. Yes, tea's the
thing.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> And the women will also have some tea. Come.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>And you, Nikíta, go and drive the sheep in and clear
away the straw.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> All right. [<i>Exeunt all but Nikíta. Nikíta lights
a cigarette. It grows darker</i>] Just see how they bother
one. Want a fellow to tell 'em how he larks about
with the wenches! It would take long to tell 'em all
those stories—“Marry her,” he says. Marry them all!
One would have a good lot of wives! And what need
have I to marry? Am as good as married now! There's
many a chap as envies me. Yet how strange it felt when
I crossed myself before the icón. It was just as if
some one shoved me. The whole web fell to pieces at
once. They say it's frightening to swear what's not
true. That's all humbug. It's all talk, that is. It's
simple enough.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA</span> [<i>enters with a rope, which she puts down. She
takes off her outdoor things and goes into closet</i>] You might
at least have got a light.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> What, to look at you? I can see you well
enough without.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> Oh, bother you!</p>

<p><i>Nan enters and whispers to Nikíta.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Nikíta, there's a person wants you. There is!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> What person?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Marína from the railway; she's out there, round
the corner.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Nonsense!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Blest if she isn't!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> What does she want?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> She wants you to come out. She says, “I only
want to say a word to Nikíta.” I began asking, but she
won't tell, but only says, “Is it true he's leaving you?”
And I say, “No, only his father wanted to take him away
and get him to marry, but he won't, and is going to stay
with us another year.” And she says, “For goodness'
sake send him out to me. I must see him,” she says, “I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>must say a word to him somehow.” She's been waiting a
long time. Why don't you go?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Bother her! What should I go for?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> She says, “If he don't come, I'll go into the hut
to him.” Blest if she didn't say she'd come in!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Not likely. She'll wait a bit and then go
away.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> “Or is it,” she says, “that they want him to marry
Akoulína?”</p>

<p><i>Re-enter Akoulína, passing near Nikíta to take her distaff.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> Marry whom to Akoulína?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Why, Nikíta.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> A likely thing! Who says it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>looks at her and laughs</i>] It seems people do say it.
Would you marry me, Akoulína?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> Who, you? Perhaps I might have afore,
but I won't now.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> And why not now?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> 'Cos you wouldn't love me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Why not?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> 'Cos you'd be forbidden to. [<i>Laughs</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Who'd forbid it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> Who? My step-mother. She does nothing
but grumble, and is always staring at you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>laughing</i>] Just hear her! Ain't she cute?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> Who? Me? What's there to be cute about?
Am I blind? She's been rowing and rowing at dad all
day. The fat-muzzled witch! [<i>Goes into closet</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN</span> [<i>looking out of the window</i>] Look, Nikíta, she's coming!
I'm blest if she isn't! I'll go away. [<i>Exit</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARÍNA</span> [<i>enters</i>] What are you doing with me?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Doing? I'm not doing anything.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARÍNA.</span> You mean to desert me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>gets up angrily</i>] What does this look like, your
coming here?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARÍNA.</span> Oh, Nikíta!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
<span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Well, you are strange! What have you come for?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARÍNA.</span> Nikíta!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> That's my name. What do you want with
Nikíta? Well, what next? Go away, I tell you!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARÍNA.</span> I see, you do want to throw me over.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Well, and what's there to remember? You
yourself don't know. When you stood out there round
the corner and sent Nan for me, and I didn't come,
wasn't it plain enough that you're not wanted? It seems
pretty simple. So there—go!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARÍNA.</span> Not wanted! So now I'm not wanted! I
believed you when you said you would love me. And
now that you've ruined me, I'm not wanted.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Where's the good of talking? This is quite
improper. You've been telling tales to father. Now, do
go away, will you?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARÍNA.</span> You know yourself I never loved any one but
you. Whether you married me or not, I'd not have been
angry. I've done you no wrong, then why have you
left off caring for me? Why?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Where's the use of baying at the moon? You
go away. Goodness me! what a duffer!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARÍNA.</span> It's not that you deceived me when you promised
to marry me that hurts, but that you've left off loving.
No, it's not that you've stopped loving me either, but
that you've changed me for another, that's what hurts.
I know who it is!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>comes up to her viciously</i>] Eh! what's the good
of talking to the likes of you, that won't listen to reason?
Be off, or you'll drive me to do something you'll be
sorry for.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARÍNA.</span> What, will you strike me, then? Well then,
strike me! What are you turning away for? Ah,
Nikíta!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Supposing some one came in. Of course, it's
quite improper. And what's the good of talking?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
<span class="speaker">MARÍNA.</span> So this is the end of it! What has been has
flown. You want me to forget it? Well then, Nikíta,
listen. I kept my maiden honour as the apple of my eye.
You have ruined me for nothing, you have deceived me.
You have no pity on a fatherless and motherless girl!
[<i>Weeping</i>] You have deserted, you have killed me, but I
bear you no malice. God forgive you! If you find a
better one you'll forget me, if a worse one you'll
remember me. Yes, you will remember, Nikíta! Good-bye,
then, if it is to be. Oh, how I loved you! Good-bye
for the last time. [<i>Takes his head in her hands and tries
to kiss him</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>tossing his head back</i>] I'm not going to talk with
the likes of you. If you won't go away I will, and you
may stay here by yourself.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARÍNA</span> [<i>screams</i>] You are a brute. [<i>In the doorway</i>]
God will give you no joy. [<i>Exit, crying</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA</span> [<i>comes out of closet</i>] You're a dog, Nikíta!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> What's up?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> What a cry she gave! [<i>Cries</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> What's up with you?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> What's up? You've hurt her so. That's
the way you'll hurt me also. You're a dog. [<i>Exit into
closet</i>].</p>

<p><i>Silence.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Here's a fine muddle. I'm as sweet as honey
on the lasses, but when a fellow's sinned with 'em it's a
bad look-out!</p>

<h2><a name="act2" id="act2">ACT II</a></h2>

<p class="scene">The scene represents the village street. To the left the
outside of Peter's hut, built of logs, with a porch in the
middle; to the right of the hut the gates and a corner
of the yard buildings. Anísya is beating hemp in the street
near the corner of the yard. Six months have elapsed since
the <a href="#act1">First Act</a>.</p>


<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>stops and listens</i>] Mumbling something again.
He's probably got off the stove.</p>

<p><i>Akoulína enters, carrying two pails on a yoke.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> He's calling. You go and see what he wants,
kicking up such a row.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> Why don't you go?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Go, I tell you! [<i>Exit Akoulína into hut</i>] He's
bothering me to death. Won't let out where the money
is, and that's all about it. He was out in the passage the
other day. He must have been hiding it there. Now, I
don't know myself where it is. Thank goodness he's
afraid of parting with it, so that at least it will stay in
the house. If only I could manage to find it. He hadn't
it on him yesterday. Now I don't know where it can be.
He has quite worn the life out of me.</p>

<p><i>Enter Akoulína, tying her kerchief over her head.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Where are you off to?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> Where? Why, he's told me to go for Aunt
Martha. “Fetch my sister,” he says. “I am going to
die,” he says. “I have a word to say to her.”</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>aside</i>] Asking for his sister? Oh my poor head!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>Sure he wants to give it her. What shall I do? Oh!
[<i>To Akoulína</i>] Don't go! Where are you off to?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> To call Aunt.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Don't go I tell you, I'll go myself. You go
and take the clothes to the river to rinse. Else you'll not
have finished by the evening.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> But he told me to go.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> You go and do as you're bid. I tell you I'll
fetch Martha myself. Take the shirts off the fence.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> The shirts? But maybe you'll not go. He's
given the order.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Didn't I say I'd go? Where's Nan?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> Nan? Minding the calves.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Send her here. I dare say they'll not run away.
[<i>Akoulína collects the clothes, and exit</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> If one doesn't go he'll scold. If one goes he'll
give the money to his sister. All my trouble will be
wasted. I don't myself know what I'm to do. My poor
head's splitting. [<i>Continues to work</i>].</p>

<p><i>Enter Matryóna, with a stick and a bundle, in outdoor
clothes.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> May the Lord help you, honey.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>looks round, stops working, and claps her hands with
joy</i>] Well, I never expected this! Mother Matryóna, God
has sent the right guest at the right time.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Well, how are things?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Ah, I'm driven well-nigh crazy. It's awful!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Well, still alive, I hear?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Oh, don't talk about it. He doesn't live and
doesn't die!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> But the money—has he given it to anybody?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> He's just sending for his sister Martha—probably
about the money.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Well, naturally! But hasn't he given it to
any one else?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> To no one. I watch like a hawk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
<span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> And where is it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> He doesn't let out. And I can't find out in
any way. He hides it now here, now there, and I can't
do anything because of Akoulína. Idiot though she is,
she keeps watch, and is always about. Oh my poor head!
I'm bothered to death.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Oh, my jewel, if he gives the money to any
one but you, you'll never cease regretting it as long as you
live! They'll turn you out of house and home without
anything. You've been worriting, and worriting all your
life with one you don't love, and will have to go a-begging
when you are a widow.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> No need to tell me, mother. My heart's that
weary, and I don't know what to do. No one to get a bit
of advice from. I told Nikíta, but he's frightened of the
job. The only thing he did was to tell me yesterday it
was hidden under the floor.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Well, and did you look there?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> I couldn't. The old man himself was in the
room. I notice that sometimes he carries it about on
him, and sometimes he hides it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> But you, my lass, must remember that if
once he gives you the slip there's no getting it right
again! [<i>Whispering</i>] Well, and did you give him the
strong tea?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Oh! oh!… [<i>About to answer, but sees neighbour
and stops</i>].</p>

<p><i>The neighbour (a woman) passes the hut, and listens to a
call from within.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR</span> [<i>to Anísya</i>] I say, Anísya! Eh, Anísya!
There's your old man calling, I think.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> That's the way he always coughs,—just as if he
were screaming. He's getting very bad.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR</span> [<i>approaches Matryóna</i>] How do you do,
granny? Have you come far?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Straight from home, dear. Come to see my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>son. Brought him some shirts—can't help thinking of
these things, you see, when it's one's own child.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> Yes, that's always so. [<i>To Anísya</i>] And I was
thinking of beginning to bleach the linen, but it is a bit
early, no one has begun yet.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Where's the hurry?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Well, and has he had communion?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Oh dear yes, the priest was here yesterday.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> I had a look at him yesterday. Dearie me!
one wonders his body and soul keep together. And, O
Lord, the other day he seemed just at his last gasp, so
that they laid him under the holy icóns.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor_1_1">[1]</a> They started
lamenting and got ready to lay him out.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> He came to, and creeps about again.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Well, and is he to have extreme unction?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> The neighbours advise it. If he lives till to-morrow
we'll send for the priest.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> Oh, Anísya dear, I should think your heart
must be heavy. As the saying goes, “Not he is sick that's
ill in bed, but he that sits and waits in dread.”</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Yes, if it were only over one way or other!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> Yes, that's true, dying for a year, it's no
joke. You're bound hand and foot like that.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Ah, but a widow's lot is also bitter. It's all
right as long as one's young, but who'll care for you when
you're old? Oh yes, old age is not pleasure. Just look
at me. I've not walked very far, and yet am so footsore I
don't know how to stand. Where's my son?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Ploughing. But you come in and we'll get the
samovár ready; the tea'll set you up again.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> [<i>sitting down</i>] Yes, it's true, I'm quite done up,
my dears. As to extreme unction, that's absolutely necessary.
Besides, they say it's good for the soul.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Yes, we'll send to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
<span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Yes, you had better. And we've had a
wedding down in our parts.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> What, in spring?<a name="FNanchor_2_2" href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor_2_2">[2]</a></p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Ah, now if it were a poor man, then, as the
saying is, it's always unseasonable for a poor man to marry.
But it's Simon Matvéyitch, he's married that Marína.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> What luck for her!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> He's a widower. I suppose there are children?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Four of 'em. What decent girl would have
him! Well, so he's taken her, and she's glad. You see,
the vessel was not sound, so the wine trickled out.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> Oh my! And what do people say to it?
And he, a rich peasant!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> They are living well enough so far.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> Yes, it's true enough. Who wants to marry
where there are children? There now, there's our
Michael. He's such a fellow, dear me …</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT'S VOICE.</span> Hullo, Mávra. Where the devil are
you? Go and drive the cow in.</p>

<p><i>Exit Neighbour.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> [<i>while the Neighbour is within hearing speaks
in her ordinary voice</i>] Yes, lass, thank goodness, she's
married. At any rate my old fool won't go bothering
about Nikíta. Now [<i>suddenly changing her tone</i>], she's
gone! [<i>Whispers</i>] I say, did you give him the tea?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Don't speak about it. He'd better die of
himself. It's no use—he doesn't die, and I have only
taken a sin on my soul. O-oh, my head, my head! Oh,
why did you give me those powders?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> What of the powders? The sleeping powders,
lass,—why not give them? No evil can come of them.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> I am not talking of the sleeping ones, but the
others, the white ones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
<span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Well, honey, those powders are medicinal.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>sighs</i>] I know, yet it's frightening. Though
he's worried me to death.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Well, and did you use many?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> I gave two doses.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Was anything noticeable?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> I had a taste of the tea myself—just a little
bitter. And he drank them with the tea and says, “Even
tea disgusts me,” and I say, “Everything tastes bitter
when one's sick.” But I felt that scared, mother.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Don't go thinking about it. The more one
thinks the worse it is.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> I wish you'd never given them to me and led
me into sin. When I think of it something seems to tear
my heart. Oh dear, why did you give them to me?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> What do you mean, honey? Lord help you!
Why are you turning it on to me? Mind, lass, don't go
twisting matters from the sick on to the healthy. If
anything were to happen, I stand aside! I know nothing!
I'm aware of nothing! I'll kiss the cross on it; I never
gave you any kind of powders, never saw any, never
heard of any, and never knew there were such powders.
You think about yourself, lass. Why, we were talking
about you the other day. “Poor thing, what torture she
endures. The step-daughter an idiot; the old man rotten,
sucking her life-blood. What wouldn't one be ready to
do in such a case!”</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> I'm not going to deny it. A life such as mine
could make one do worse than that. It could make you
hang yourself or throttle him. Is this a life?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> That's just it. There's no time to stand
gaping; the money must be found one way or other, and
then he must have his tea.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> O-oh, my head, my head! I can't think what
to do. I am so frightened; he'd better die of himself.
I don't want to have it on my soul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
<span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> [<i>viciously</i>] And why doesn't he show the
money? Does he mean to take it along with him? Is
no one to have it? Is that right? God forbid such a
sum should be lost all for nothing. Isn't that a sin?
What's he doing? Is he worth considering?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> I don't know anything. He's worried me to
death.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> What is it you don't know? The business
is clear. If you make a slip now, you'll repent it all your
life. He'll give the money to his sister and you'll be
left without.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> O-oh dear! Yes, and he did send for her—I
must go.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> You wait a bit and light the samovár first.
We'll give him some tea and search him together—we'll
find it, no fear.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Oh dear, oh dear; supposing something were
to happen.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> What now? What's the good of waiting?
Do you want the money to slip from your hand when it's
just in sight? You go and do as I say.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Well, I'll go and light the samovár.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Go, honey, do the business so as not to
regret it afterwards. That's right! [<i>Anísya turns to go.
Matryóna calls her back</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Just a word. Don't tell Nikíta about the
business. He's silly. God forbid he should find out
about the powders. The Lord only knows what he would
do. He's so tender-hearted. D'you know, he usen't to
be able to kill a chicken. Don't tell him. 'Twould be a
fine go, he wouldn't understand things. [<i>Stops horror-struck
as Peter appears in the doorway</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER</span> [<i>holding on to the wall, creeps out into the porch
and calls with a faint voice</i>] How's it one can't make you
hear? Oh, oh, Anísya! Who's there? [<i>Drops on the
bench</i>].</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
<span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>steps from behind the corner</i>] Why have you
come out? You should have stayed where you were lying.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Has the girl gone for Martha? It's very hard.…
Oh, if only death would come quicker!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> She had no time. I sent her to the river.
Wait a bit, I'll go myself when I'm ready.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Send Nan. Where's she? Oh, I'm that bad!
Oh, death's at hand!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> I've sent for her already.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Oh dear! Then where is she?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Where's she got to, the plague seize her!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Oh, dear! I can't bear it. All my inside's on
fire. It's as if a gimlet were boring me. Why have you
left me as if I were a dog?… no one to give me a drink.…
Oh … send Nan to me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Here she is. Nan, go to father.</p>

<p><i>Nan runs in. Anísya goes behind the corner of the house.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Go you. Oh … to Aunt Martha, tell her
father wants her; say she's to come, I want her.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> All right.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Wait a bit. Tell her she's to come quick. Tell
her I'm dying. O-oh!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> I'll just get my shawl and be off. [<i>Runs off</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> [<i>winking</i>] Now then, mind and look sharp,
lass. Go into the hut, hunt about everywhere, like a dog
that's hunting for fleas: look under everything, and I'll
search him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>to Matryóna</i>] I feel a bit bolder, somehow,
now you're here. [<i>Goes up to porch. To Peter</i>] Hadn't
I better light the samovár? Here's Mother Matryóna
come to see her son; you'll have a cup of tea with her?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Well then, light it. [<i>Anísya goes into the house.
Matryóna comes up to the porch</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> How do you do?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> [<i>bowing</i>] How d'you do, my benefactor;
how d'you do, my precious … still ill, I see. And my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>old man, he's that sorry! “Go,” says he, “see how he's
getting on.” He sends his respects to you. [<i>Bows again</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> I'm dying.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Ah yes, Peter Ignátitch, now I look at you
I see, as the saying has it, “Sickness lives where men
live.” You've shrivelled, shrivelled, all to nothing, poor
dear, now I come to look at you. Seems illness does not
add to good looks.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> My last hour has come.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Oh well, Peter Ignátitch, it's God's will you
know, you've had communion, and you'll have unction,
God willing. Your missus is a wise woman, the Lord be
thanked; she'll give you a good burial, and have prayers
said for your soul, all most respectable! And my son,
he'll look after things meanwhile.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> There'll be no one to manage things! She's
not steady. Has her head full of folly—why, I know all
about it, I know. And my girl is silly and young. I've
got the homestead together, and there's no one to attend
to things. One can't help feeling it. [<i>Whimpers</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Why, if it's money, or something, you can
leave orders.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER</span> [<i>to Anísya inside the house</i>] Has Nan gone?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> [<i>aside</i>] There now, he's remembered!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>from inside</i>] She went then and there. Come
inside, won't you? I'll help you in.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Let me sit here a bit for the last time. The
air's so stuffy inside. Oh, how bad I feel! Oh, my
heart's burning.… Oh, if death would only come.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> If God don't take a soul, the soul can't go
out. Death and life are in God's will, Peter Ignátitch.
You can't be sure of death either. Maybe you'll recover
yet. There was a man in our village just like that, at
the very point of death …</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> No, I feel I shall die to-day, I feel it. [<i>Leans
back and shuts his eyes</i>].</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
<span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>enters</i>] Well now, are you coming in or not?
You do keep one waiting. Peter! eh, Peter!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> [<i>steps aside and beckons to Anísya with her finger</i>]
Well?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>comes down the porch steps</i>] Not there.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> But have you searched everywhere? Under
the floor?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> No, it's not there either. In the shed perhaps;
he was rummaging there yesterday.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Go, search, search for all you're worth. Go
all over everywhere, as if you licked with your tongue!
But I see he'll die this very day, his nails are turning
blue and his face looks earthy. Is the samovár ready?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Just on the boil.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>comes from the other side, if possible on horseback,
up to the gate, and does not see Peter. To Matryóna</i>] How
d'you do, mother, is all well at home?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> The Lord be thanked, we're all alive and
have a crust to bite.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Well, and how's master?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Hush, there he sits. [<i>Points to porch</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Well, let him sit. What's it to me?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER</span> [<i>opens his eyes</i>] Nikíta, I say, Nikíta, come here!
[<i>Nikíta approaches. Anísya and Matryóna whisper together</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Why have you come back so early?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> I've finished ploughing.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Have you done the strip beyond the bridge?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> It's too far to go there.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Too far? From here it's still farther. You'll
have to go on purpose now. You might have made one
job of it. [<i>Anísya, without showing herself, stands and listens</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> [<i>approaches</i>] Oh, sonnie, why don't you take
more pains for your master? Your master is ill and
depends on you; you should serve him as you would your
own father, straining every muscle just as I always tell
you to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
<span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Well then—o-oh!… Get out the seed potatoes,
and the women will go and sort them.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>aside</i>] No fear, I'm not going. He's again
sending every one away; he must have the money on him
now, and wants to hide it somewhere.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Else … o-oh! when the time comes for planting,
they'll all be rotten. Oh, I can't stand it! [<i>Rises</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> [<i>runs up into the porch and holds Peter up</i>]
Shall I help you into the hut?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Help me in. [<i>Stops</i>] Nikíta!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>angrily</i>] What now?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> I shan't see you again … I'll die to-day.…
Forgive me,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor_3_3">[3]</a> for Christ's sake, forgive me if I have ever
sinned against you … If I have sinned in word or
deed … There's been all sorts of things. Forgive me!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> What's there to forgive? I'm a sinner myself.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Ah, sonnie, have some feeling.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Forgive me, for Christ's sake. [<i>Weeps</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>snivels</i>] God will forgive you, Daddy Peter. I
have no cause to complain of you. You've never done
me any wrong. You forgive me; maybe I've sinned
worse against you. [<i>Weeps</i>].</p>

<p><i>Peter goes in whimpering, Matryóna supporting him.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Oh, my poor head! It's not without some
reason he's hit on that. [<i>Approaches Nikíta</i>] Why did
you say the money was under the floor? It's not there.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>does not answer, but cries</i>] I have never had
anything bad from him, nothing but good, and what have
I gone and done!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Enough now! Where's the money?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>angrily</i>] How should I know? Go and look
for it yourself!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
<span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> What's made you so tender?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> I am sorry for him,—that sorry. How he cried!
Oh dear!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Look at him,—seized with pity! He has found
someone to pity too! He's been treating you like a dog,
and even just now was giving orders to have you turned
out of the house. You'd better show me some pity!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> What are you to be pitied for?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> If he dies, and the money's been hidden
away …</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> No fear, he'll not hide it …</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Oh, Nikíta darling! he's sent for his sister, and
wants to give it to her. It will be a bad lookout for us.
How are we going to live, if he gives her the money?
They'll turn me out of the house! You try and manage
somehow! You said he went to the shed last night.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> I saw him coming from there, but where he's
shoved it to, who can tell?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Oh, my poor head! I'll go and have a look
there. [<i>Nikíta steps aside</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> [<i>comes out of the hut and down the steps of the
porch to Anísya and Nikíta</i>] Don't go anywhere. He's
got the money on him. I felt it on a string round his
neck.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Oh my head, my head!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> If you don't keep wide awake now, then
you may whistle for it. If his sister comes—then good-bye
to it!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> That's true. She'll come and he'll give it her.
What's to be done? Oh my poor head!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> What is to be done? Why, look here;
the samovár is boiling, go and make the tea and pour
him out a cup, and then [<i>whispers</i>] put in all that's left in
the paper. When he's drunk the cup, then just take it.
He'll not tell, no fear.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Oh! I'm afeared!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
<span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Don't be talking now, but look alive, and
I'll keep his sister off if need be. Mind, don't make a
blunder! Get hold of the money and bring it here, and
Nikíta will hide it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Oh my head, my head! I don't know how I'm
going to …</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Don't talk about it I tell you, do as I bid
you. Nikíta!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> What is it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> You stay here—sit down—in case something
is wanted.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>waves his hand</i>] Oh these women, what won't they
be up to? Muddle one up completely. Bother them!
I'll really go and fetch out the potatoes.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> [<i>catches him by the arm</i>] Stay here, I tell
you.</p>

<p><i>Nan enters.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Well?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> She was down in her daughter's vegetable plot—she's
coming.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Coming! What shall we do?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> There's plenty of time if you do as I tell
you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> I don't know what to do; I know nothing, my
brain's all in a whirl. Nan! Go, daughter, and see to
the calves, they'll have run away, I'm afraid.… Oh
dear, I haven't the courage.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Go on! I should think the samovár's boiling
over.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Oh my head, my poor head! [<i>Exit</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> [<i>approaches Nikíta</i>] Now then, sonnie. [<i>Sits
down beside him</i>] Your affairs must also be thought about,
and not left anyhow.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> What affairs?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Why, this affair—how you're to live your
life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
<span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> How to live my life? Others live, and I shall
live!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> The old man will probably die to-day.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Well, if he dies, God give him rest! What's
that to me?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> [<i>keeps looking towards the porch while she
speaks</i>] Eh, sonnie! Those that are alive have to think
about living. One needs plenty of sense in these matters,
honey. What do you think? I've tramped all over the
place after your affairs, I've got quite footsore bothering
about matters. And you must not forget me when the
time comes.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> And what's it you've been bothering about?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> About your affairs, about your future. If you
don't take trouble in good time you'll get nothing. You
know Iván Moséitch? Well, I've been to him too. I
went there the other day. I had something else to settle,
you know. Well, so I sat and chatted awhile and then
came to the point. “Tell me, Iván Moséitch,” says I,
“how's one to manage an affair of this kind? Supposing,”
says I, “a peasant as is a widower married a
second wife, and supposing all the children he has is a
daughter by the first wife, and a daughter by the second.
Then,” says I, “when that peasant dies, could an outsider
get hold of the homestead by marrying the widow?
Could he,” says I, “give both the daughters in marriage
and remain master of the house himself?” “Yes, he
could,” says he, “but,” says he, “it would mean a deal
of trouble; still the thing could be managed by means of
money, but if there's no money it's no good trying.”</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>laughs</i>] That goes without saying, only fork out
the money. Who does not want money?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Well then, honey, so I spoke out plainly
about the affair. And he says, “First and foremost, your
son will have to get himself on the register of that village—that
will cost something. The elders will have to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>treated. And they, you see, they'll sign. Everything,”
says he, “must be done sensibly.” Look, [<i>unwraps her
kerchief and takes out a paper</i>] he's written out this paper;
just read it, you're a scholar, you know. [<i>Nikíta reads</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> This paper's only a decision for the elders to
sign. There's no great wisdom needed for that.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> But you just hear what Iván Moséitch bids
us do. “Above all,” he says, “mind and don't let the
money slip away, dame. If she don't get hold of the
money,” he says, “they'll not let her do it. Money's the
great thing!” So look out, sonnie, things are coming to
a head.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> What's that to me? The money's hers—so let
her look out.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Ah, sonnie, how you look at it! How can
a woman manage such affairs? Even if she does get
the money, is she capable of arranging it all? One knows
what a woman is! You're a man anyhow. You can hide
it, and all that. You see, you've after all got more sense,
in case of anything happening.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Oh, your woman's notions are all so inexpedient!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Why inexpedient? You just collar the
money, and the woman's in your hands. And then should
she ever turn snappish you'd be able to tighten the reins!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Bother you all,—I'm going.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>quite pale, runs out of the hut and round the corner
to Matryóna</i>] So it was, it was on him! Here it is!
[<i>Shows that she has something under her apron</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Give it to Nikíta, he'll hide it. Nikíta, take
it and hide it somewhere.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> All right, give here!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> O-oh, my poor head! No, I'd better do it
myself. [<i>Goes towards the gate</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> [<i>seizing her by the arm</i>] Where are you going
to? You'll be missed. There's the sister coming; give
it him; he knows what to do. Eh, you blockhead!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
<span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>stops irresolutely</i>] Oh, my head, my head!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Well, give it here. I'll shove it away somewhere.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Where will you shove it to?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>laughing</i>] Why, are you afraid?</p>

<p><i>Enter Akoulína, carrying clothes from the wash.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> O-oh, my poor head! [<i>Gives the money</i>] Mind,
Nikíta.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> What are you afraid of? I'll hide it so that
I'll not be able to find it myself. [<i>Exit</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>stands in terror</i>] Oh dear, and supposing he …</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Well, is he dead?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Yes, he seems dead. He did not move when I
took it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Go in, there's Akoulína.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Well there, I've done the sin and he has the
money.…</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Have done and go in! There's Martha coming!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> There now, I've trusted him. What's going
to happen now? [<i>Exit</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARTHA</span> [<i>enters from one side, Akoulína enters from the
other. To Akoulína</i>] I should have come before, but I was
at my daughter's. Well, how's the old man? Is he
dying?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA</span> [<i>puts down the clothes</i>] Don't know, I've been
to the river.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARTHA</span> [<i>pointing to Matryóna</i>] Who's that?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> I'm from Zoúevo. I'm Nikíta's mother from
Zoúevo, my dearie. Good afternoon to you. He's
withering, withering away, poor dear—your brother, I
mean. He came out himself. “Send for my sister,” he
said, “because,” said he … Dear me, why, I do believe,
he's dead!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>runs out screaming. Clings to a post, and begins
wailing</i>]<a name="FNanchor_4_4" href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor_4_4">[4]</a> Oh, oh, ah! who-o-o-m have you left me

<h2>ACT III</h2>

<p class="scene">The same hut. Winter. Nine months have passed since
<a href="#act2">Act II</a>. Anísya, plainly dressed, sits before a loom weaving.
Nan is on the oven.</p>


<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH</span> [<i>an old labourer, enters, and slowly takes off his
outdoor things</i>] Oh Lord, have mercy! Well, hasn't the
master come home yet?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Nikíta isn't back from town, is he?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Must have been on the spree. Oh Lord!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Have you finished in the stackyard?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> What d'you think? Got it all as it should
be, and covered everything with straw! I don't like
doing things by halves! Oh Lord! holy Nicholas! [<i>Picks
at the corns on his hands</i>] But it's time he was back.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> What need has he to hurry? He's got money.
Merry-making with that girl, I daresay …</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Why shouldn't one make merry if one has
the money? And why did Akoulína go to town?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> You'd better ask her. How do I know what
the devil took her there!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> What! to town? There's all sorts of things
to be got in town if one's got the means. Oh Lord!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Mother, I heard myself. “I'll get you a little
shawl,” he says, blest if he didn't; “you shall choose it
yourself,” he says. And she got herself up so fine; she
put on her velveteen coat and the French shawl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
<span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Really, a girl's modesty reaches only to the
door. Step over the threshold and it's forgotten. She
is a shameless creature.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Oh my! What's the use of being ashamed?
While there's plenty of money make merry. Oh Lord!
It is too soon to have supper, eh? [<i>Anísya does not answer</i>]
I'll go and get warm meanwhile. [<i>Climbs on the stove</i>]
Oh Lord! Blessed Virgin Mother! holy Nicholas!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR</span> [<i>enters</i>] Seems your goodman's not back yet?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> It's time he was. Hasn't he perhaps
stopped at our inn? My sister, Thekla, says there's heaps
of sledges standing there as have come from the town.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Nan! Nan, I say!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Yes?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> You run to the inn and see! Mayhap, being
drunk, he's gone there.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN</span> [<i>jumps down from the oven and dresses</i>] All right.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> And he's taken Akoulína with him?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Else he'd not have had any need of going. It's
because of her he's unearthed all the business there.
“Must go to the bank,” he says; “it's time to receive
the payments,” he says. But it's all her fooling.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR</span> [<i>shakes her head</i>] It's a bad look-out.
[<i>Silence</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN</span> [<i>at the door</i>] And if he's there, what am I to say?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> You only see if he's there.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> All right. I'll be back in a winking. [<i>Long
silence</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH</span> [<i>roars</i>] Oh Lord! merciful Nicholas!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR</span> [<i>starting</i>] Oh, how he scared me? Who
is it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Why, Mítritch, our labourer.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> Oh dear, oh dear, what a fright he did
give me! I had quite forgotten. But tell me, dear,
I've heard someone's been wooing Akoulína?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
<span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>gets up from the loom and sits down by the table</i>]
There was some one from Dédlovo; but it seems the
affair's got wind there too. They made a start, and
then stopped; so the thing fell through. Of course,
who'd care to?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> And the Lizounófs from Zoúevo?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> They made some steps too, but it didn't come
off either. They won't even see us.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> Yet it's time she was married.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Time and more than time! Ah, my dear, I'm
that impatient to get her out of the house; but the
matter does not come off. He does not wish it, nor she
either. He's not yet had enough of his beauty, you
see.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> Eh, eh, eh, what doings! Only think of it.
Why, he's her step-father!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Ah, friend, they've taken me in completely.
They've done me so fine it's beyond saying. I, fool that
I was, noticed nothing, suspected nothing, and so I married
him. I guessed nothing, but they already understood
one another.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> Oh dear, what goings on!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> So it went on from bad to worse, and I see they
begin hiding from me. Ah, friend, I was that sick—that
sick of my life! It's not as if I didn't love him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> That goes without saying.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Ah, how hard it is to bear such treatment from
him! Oh, how it hurts!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> Yes, and I've heard say he's becoming too
free with his fists?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> And that too! There was a time when he was
gentle when he'd had a drop. He used to hit out before,
but of me he was always fond! But now when he's in a
temper he goes for me and is ready to trample me under
his feet. The other day he got both hands entangled in
my hair so that I could hardly get away. And the girl's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>worse than a serpent; it's a wonder the earth bears such
furies.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> Ah, ah, my dear, now I look at you, you
are a sufferer! To suffer like that is no joke. To have
given shelter to a beggar, and he to lead you such a
dance! Why don't you pull in the reins?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Ah, but my dear, if it weren't for my heart!
Him as is gone was stern enough, still I could twist him
about any way I liked; but with this one I can do nothing.
As soon as I see him all my anger goes. I haven't a grain
of courage before him; I go about like a drowned hen.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> Ah, neighbour, you must be under a spell.
I've heard that Matryóna goes in for that sort of thing.
It must be her.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Yes, dear; I think so myself sometimes.
Gracious me, how hurt I feel at times! I'd like to
tear him to pieces. But when I set eyes on him, my
heart won't go against him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> It's plain you're bewitched. It don't take
long to blight a body. There now, when I look at you,
what you have dwindled to!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Growing a regular spindle-shanks. And just
look at that fool Akoulína. Wasn't the girl a regular
untidy slattern, and just look at her now! Where has it
all come from? Yes, he has fitted her out. She's grown
so smart, so puffed up, just like a bubble that's ready to
burst. And, though she's a fool, she's got it into her
head, “I'm the mistress,” she says; “the house is mine;
it's me father wanted him to marry.” And she's that
vicious! Lord help us, when she gets into a rage she's
ready to tear the thatch off the house.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> Oh dear, what a life yours is, now I come
to look at you. And yet there's people envying you:
“They're rich,” they say; but it seems that gold don't
keep tears from falling.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Much reason for envy indeed! And the riches,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>too, will soon be made ducks and drakes of. Dear me,
how he squanders money!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> But how's it, dear, you've been so simple
to give up the money? It's yours.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Ah, if you knew all! The thing is that I've
made one little mistake.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> Well, if I were you, I'd go straight and
have the law of him. The money's yours; how dare he
squander it? There's no such rights.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> They don't pay heed to that nowadays.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> Ah, my dear, now I come to look at you,
you've got that weak.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Yes, quite weak, dear, quite weak. He's got
me into a regular fix. I don't myself know anything.
Oh, my poor head!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR</span> [<i>listening</i>] There's someone coming, I think.
[<i>The door opens and Akím enters</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM</span> [<i>crosses himself, knocks the snow off his feet, and takes
off his coat</i>] Peace be to this house! How do you do?
Are you well, daughter?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> How d'you do, father? Do you come straight
from home?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> I've been a-thinking, I'll go and see what's name,
go to see my son, I mean,—my son. I didn't start
early—had my dinner, I mean; I went, and it's so what
d'you call it—so snowy, hard walking, and so there I'm
what d'you call it—late, I mean. And my son—is he at
home? At home? My son, I mean.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> No; he's gone to the town.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM</span> [<i>sits down on a bench</i>] I've some business with
him, d'you see, some business, I mean. I told him t'other
day, told him I was in need—told him, I mean, that our
horse was done for, our horse, you see. So we must what
d'ye call it, get a horse, I mean, some kind of a horse, I
mean. So there, I've come, you see.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Nikíta told me. When he comes back you'll
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>have a talk. [<i>Goes to the oven</i>] Have some supper now,
and he'll soon come. Mítritch, eh Mítritch, come have
your supper.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Oh Lord! merciful Nicholas!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Come to supper.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> I shall go now. Good-night. [<i>Exit</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH</span> [<i>gets down from the oven</i>] I never noticed
how I fell asleep. Oh Lord! gracious Nicholas! How
d'you do, Daddy Akím?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> Ah, Mítritch! What are you, what d'ye call it, I
mean?…</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Why, I'm working for your son, Nikíta.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> Dear me! What d'ye call … working for my
son, I mean. Dear me!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> I was living with a tradesman in town, but
drank all I had there. Now I've come back to the
village. I've no home, so I've gone into service. [<i>Gapes</i>]
Oh Lord!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> But how's that, what d'you call it, or what's
name, Nikíta, what does he do? Has he some business,
I mean besides, that he should hire a labourer, a labourer
I mean, hire a labourer?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> What business should he have? He used to
manage, but now he's other things on his mind, so he's
hired a labourer.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Why shouldn't he, seeing he has money?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> Now that's what d'you call it, that's wrong, I
mean, quite wrong, I mean. That's spoiling oneself.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Oh, he has got spoilt, that spoilt, it's just
awful.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> There now, what d'you call it, one thinks how
to make things better, and it gets worse I mean. Riches
spoil a man, spoil, I mean.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Fatness makes even a dog go mad; how's one
not to get spoilt by fat living? Myself now; how I went
on with fat living. I drank for three weeks without being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>sober. I drank my last breeches. When I had nothing
left, I gave it up. Now I've determined not to. Bother
it!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> And where's what d'you call, your old woman?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> My old woman has found her right place,
old fellow. She's hanging about the gin-shops in town.
She's a swell too; one eye knocked out, and the other
black, and her muzzle twisted to one side. And she's
never sober; drat her!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> Oh, oh, oh, how's that?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> And where's a soldier's wife to go? She has
found her right place. [<i>Silence</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM</span> [<i>to Anísya</i>] And Nikíta,—has he what d'you call
it, taken anything up to town? I mean, anything to
sell?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>laying the table and serving up</i>] No, he's taken
nothing. He's gone to get money from the bank.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM</span> [<i>sitting down to supper</i>] Why? D'you wish to put
it to another use, the money I mean?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> No, we don't touch it. Only some twenty or
thirty roubles as have come due; they must be taken.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> Must be taken. Why take it, the money I
mean? You'll take some to-day I mean, and some to-morrow;
and so you'll what d'you call it, take it all, I
mean.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> We get this besides. The money is all safe.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> All safe? How's that, safe? You take it, and
it what d'you call it, it's all safe. How's that? You put
a heap of meal into a bin, or a barn, I mean, and go on
taking meal, will it remain there what d'you call it, all
safe I mean? That's, what d'you call it, it's cheating.
You'd better find out, or else they'll cheat you. Safe
indeed! I mean you what d'ye call … you take it and
it remains all safe there?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> I know nothing about it. Iván Moséitch advised
us at the time. “Put the money in the bank,” he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>said, “the money will be safe, and you'll get interest,”
he said.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH</span> [<i>having finished his supper</i>] That's so. I've
lived with a tradesman. They all do like that. Put the
money in the bank, then lie down on the oven and it
will keep coming in.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> That's queer talk. How's that—what d'ye call,
coming in, how's that coming in, and they, who do they
get it from I mean, the money I mean?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> They take the money out of the bank.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Get along! 'Tain't a thing a woman can
understand! You look here, I'll make it all clear to you.
Mind and remember. You see, suppose you've got some
money, and I, for instance, have spring coming on, my
land's idle, I've got no seeds, or I have to pay taxes.
So, you see, I go to you. “Akím,” I say, “give us a
ten-rouble note, and when I've harvested in autumn I'll
return it, and till two acres for you besides, for having
obliged me!” And you, seeing I've something to fall
back on—a horse say, or a cow—you say, “No, give two
or three roubles for the obligation,” and there's an end of
it. I'm stuck in the mud, and can't do without. So I
say, “All right!” and take a tenner. In the autumn,
when I've made my turnover, I bring it back, and you
squeeze the extra three roubles out of me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> Yes, but that's what peasants do when they what
d'ye call it, when they forget God. It's not honest, I
mean, it's no good, I mean.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> You wait. You'll see it comes just to the
same thing. Now don't forget how you've skinned me.
And Anísya, say, has got some money lying idle. She
does not know what to do with it, besides, she's a
woman, and does not know how to use it. She comes to
you. “Couldn't you make some profit with my money
too?” she says. “Why not?” say you, and you wait.
Before the summer I come again and say, “Give me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>another tenner, and I'll be obliged.” Then you find out
if my hide isn't all gone, and if I can be skinned again
you give me Anísya's money. But supposing I'm clean
shorn,—have nothing to eat,—then you see I can't be
fleeced any more, and you say, “Go your way, friend,”
and you look out for another, and lend him your own and
Anísya's money and skin him. That's what the bank is.
So it goes round and round. It's a cute thing, old fellow!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM</span> [<i>excitedly</i>] Gracious me, whatever is that like?
It's what d'ye call it, it's filthy! The peasants—what
d'ye call it, the peasants do so I mean, and know it's,
what d'ye call it, a sin! It's what d'you call, not right,
not right, I mean. It's filthy! How can people as have
learnt … what d'ye call it …</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> That, old fellow, is just what they're fond of!
And remember, them that are stupid, or the women folk,
as can't put their money into use themselves, they take
it to the bank, and they there, deuce take 'em, clutch
hold of it, and with this money they fleece the people.
It's a cute thing!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM</span> [<i>sighing</i>] Oh dear, I see, what d'ye call it, without
money it's bad, and with money it's worse! How's
that? God told us to work, but you, what d'ye call …
I mean you put money into the bank and go to sleep, and
the money will what d'ye call it, will feed you while you
sleep. It's filthy, that's what I call it; it's not right.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Not right? Eh, old fellow, who cares about
that nowadays? And how clean they pluck you, too!
That's the fact of the matter.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM</span> [<i>sighs</i>] Ah yes, seems the time's what d'ye call
it, the time's growing ripe. There, I've had a look at the
closets in town. What they've come to! It's all polished
and polished I mean, it's fine, it's what d'ye call it, it's
like inside an inn. And what's it all for? What's the
good of it? Oh, they've forgotten God. Forgotten, I
mean. We've forgotten, forgotten God, God I mean!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>Thank you, my dear, I've had enough. I'm quite satisfied.
[<i>Rises. Mítritch climbs on to the oven</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>eats, and collects the dishes</i>] If his father would
only take him to task! But I'm ashamed to tell him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> What d'you say?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Oh! it's nothing.</p>

<p><i>Enter Nan.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> Here's a good girl, always busy! You're cold, I
should think?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Yes, I am, terribly. How d'you do, grandfather?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Well? Is he there?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> No. But Andriyán is there. He's been to town,
and he says he saw them at an inn in town. He says
Dad's as drunk as drunk can be!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Do you want anything to eat? Here you are.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN</span> [<i>goes to the oven</i>] Well, it <em>is</em> cold. My hands are
quite numb. [<i>Akím takes off his leg-bands and bast-shoes.
Anísya washes up</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Father!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> Well, what is it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> And is Marína living well?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> Yes, she's living all right. The little woman is
what d'ye call it, clever and steady; she's living, and what
d'ye call it, doing her best. She's all right; the little
woman's of the right sort I mean; painstaking and what
d'ye call it, submissive; the little woman's all right I
mean, all right, you know.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> And is there no talk in your village that a
relative of Marína's husband thinks of marrying our
Akoulína? Have you heard nothing of it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> Ah; that's Mirónof. Yes, the women did chatter
something. But I didn't pay heed, you know.
It don't interest me I mean, I don't know anything.
Yes, the old women did say something, but I've a bad
memory, bad memory, I mean. But the Mirónofs are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>what d'ye call it, they're all right, I mean they're all
right.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> I'm that impatient to get her settled.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> And why?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN</span> [<i>listens</i>] They've come!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Well, don't you go bothering them. [<i>Goes on
washing the spoons without turning her head</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>enters</i>] Anísya! Wife! who has come? [<i>Anísya
looks up and turns away in silence</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>severely</i>] Who has come? Have you forgotten?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Now don't humbug. Come in!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>still more severely</i>] Who's come?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>goes up and takes him by the arm</i>] Well then,
husband has come. Now then, come in!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>holds back</i>] Ah, that's it! Husband! And
what's husband called? Speak properly.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Oh bother you! Nikíta!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Where have you learnt manners? The full
name.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Nikíta Akímitch! Now then!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>still in the doorway</i>] Ah, that's it! But now—the
surname?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>laughs and pulls him by the arm</i>] Tchilíkin.
Dear me, what airs!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Ah, that's it. [<i>Holds on to the door-post</i>] No,
now say with which foot Tchilíkin steps into this
house!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> That's enough! You're letting the cold in!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Say with which foot he steps? You've got to
say it,—that's flat.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>aside</i>] He'll go on worrying. [<i>To Nikíta</i>] Well
then, with the left. Come in!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Ah, that's it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> You look who's in the hut!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Ah, my parent! Well, what of that? I'm not

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> Why have you thrown everything about?
Where's the yarn?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> The yarn? The yarn's there. Hullo, Mítritch,
where are you? Asleep? Asleep? Go and put the
horse up.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM</span> [<i>not seeing Akoulína but looking at his son</i>] Dear
me, what is he doing? The old man's what d'ye call it,

him, what d'ye call it, putting on airs! Put up the
horse! Faugh, what filth!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH</span> [<i>climbs down from the oven, and puts on felt

Done it to death, I dare say. Just see how he's been

Lord, holy Nicholas! [<i>Puts on sheepskin, and exit</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>sits down</i>] You must forgive me, father. It's

will drink. Ain't it true? So you must forgive me.
Never mind Mítritch, he doesn't mind, he'll put it up.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Shall I really light the samovár?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Light it! My parent has come. I wish to talk

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>are you doing, you scoundrel? Do you think there's no
law for you? You wait a bit!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Now then!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> I'll go to the Elder! To the policeman!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Off, I tell you! [<i>Pushes her out</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>behind the door</i>] I'll hang myself!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> No fear!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Oh, oh, oh! Mother, dear, darling! [<i>Cries</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Me frightened of her! A likely thing! What
are you crying for? She'll come back, no fear. Go and
see to the samovár. [<i>Exit Nan</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA</span> [<i>collects and folds her presents</i>] The mean
wretch, how she's messed it up. But wait a bit, I'll cut
up her jacket for her! Sure I will!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> I've turned her out, what more do you want?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> She's dirtied my new shawl. If that bitch
hadn't gone away, I'd have torn her eyes out!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> That's enough. Why should you be angry?
Now if I loved her …</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> Loved her? She's worth loving, with her fat
mug! If you'd have given her up, then nothing would
have happened. You should have sent her to the devil.
And the house was mine all the same, and the money was
mine! Says she is the mistress, but what sort of mistress
is she to her husband? She's a murderess, that's
what she is! She'll serve you the same way!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Oh dear, how's one to stop a woman's jaw?
You don't yourself know what you're jabbering about!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> Yes, I do. I'll not live with her! I'll turn
her out of the house! She can't live here with me.
The mistress indeed! She's not the mistress,—that jailbird!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> That's enough! What have you to do with
her? Don't mind her. You look at me! I am the
master! I do as I like. I've ceased to love her, and
now I love you. I love who I like! The power is mine,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>she's under me. That's where I keep her. [<i>Points to his

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> And where's your mother?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> She's standing and crying out there in the passage.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Oh, that's it! Call her, and tell her to bring
the samovár. And you, Akoulína, get the tea things.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> The tea things? All right. [<i>Brings the things</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>unpacks spirits, rusks, and salt herrings</i>] That's for

there in the passage, and here's the money. Wait a bit,

80 kopéykas, oil … Father, 10 roubles.… Father,

<span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Where shall I put it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Here on the table. Well! have you been to
the Elder? Ah, that's it! Have your say and then eat
your words. Now then, that's enough. Don't be cross,
sit down and drink this. [<i>Fills a wine-glass for her</i>] And

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>does not see the money</i>] Why have you put on

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> I'm going, going I mean; forgive me for the

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> My gracious! Where are you going to at this

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> I can't, I mean what d'ye call 'em, in your house,

forgive me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> But are you going without having any tea?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM</span> [<i>fastens his belt</i>] Going, because, I mean, it's not
right in your house, I mean, what d'you call it, not right,
Nikíta, in the house, what d'ye call it, not right! I mean,
you are living a bad life, Nikíta, bad,—I'll go.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Eh now! Have done talking! Sit down and
drink your tea!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Why, father, you'll shame us before the neighbours.
What has offended you?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> Nothing what d'ye call it, nothing has offended
me, nothing at all! I mean only, I see, what d'you call
it, I mean, I see my son, to ruin I mean, to ruin, I mean
my son's on the road to ruin, I mean.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> What ruin? Just prove it!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> Ruin, ruin; you're in the midst of it! What did
I tell you that time?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> You said all sorts of things!</p>

… All that's past!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM</span> [<i>excited</i>] Past! No, lad, it's not past. Sin, I
mean, fastens on to sin—drags sin after it, and you've
stuck fast, Nikíta, fast in sin! Stuck fast in sin! I see
you're fast in sin. Stuck fast, sunk in sin, I mean!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Sit down and drink your tea, and have done
with it!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> I can't, I mean can't what d'ye call it, can't
drink tea. Because of your filth, I mean; I feel what
d'ye call it, I feel sick, very sick! I can't what d'ye call
it, I can't drink tea with you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Eh! There he goes rambling! Come to the
table.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> You're in your riches same as in a net—you're
in a net, I mean. Ah, Nikíta, it's the soul that God
needs!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Now really, what right have you to reprove me
in my own house? Why do you keep on at me? Am I
a child that you can pull by the hair? Nowadays those
things have been dropped!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> That's true. I have heard that nowadays, what
d'ye call it, that nowadays children pull their fathers'
beards, I mean! But that's ruin, that's ruin, I mean!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>angrily</i>] We are living without help from you,
and it's you who came to us with your wants!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> The money? There's your money! I'll go begging,
begging I mean, before I'll take it, I mean.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> That's enough! Why be angry and upset the
whole company! [<i>Holds him by the arm</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM</span> [<i>shrieks</i>] Let go! I'll not stay. I'd rather sleep

It's the soul that God wants! [<i>Exit</i>].</p>

<h2>ACT IV</h2>

<p class="scene">Autumn. Evening. The moon is shining. The stage represents
the interior of courtyard. The scenery at the back
shows, in the middle, the back porch of the hut. To the right
the winter half of the hut and the gate; to the left the summer
half and the cellar. To the right of the stage is a shed. The
sound of tipsy voices and shouts are heard from the hut.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor_5_5">[5]</a>
Second Neighbour Woman comes out of the hut and beckons to
First Neighbour Woman.</p>


<p><span class="speaker">SECOND NEIGHBOUR.</span> How's it Akoulína has not shown
herself?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST NEIGHBOUR.</span> Why hasn't she shown herself? She'd
have been glad to; but she's too ill, you know. The
suitor's relatives have come, and want to see the girl; and
she, my dear, she's lying in the cold hut and can't come
out, poor thing!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SECOND NEIGHBOUR.</span> But how's that?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST NEIGHBOUR.</span> They say she's been bewitched by an
evil eye! She's got pains in the stomach!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SECOND NEIGHBOUR.</span> You don't say so?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST NEIGHBOUR.</span> What else could it be? [<i>Whispers</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SECOND NEIGHBOUR.</span> Dear me! There's a go! But his
relatives will surely find it out?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST NEIGHBOUR.</span> They find it out! They're all drunk!
Besides, they are chiefly after her dowry. Just think what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>they give with the girl! Two furs, my dear, six dresses,
a French shawl, and I don't know how many pieces
of linen, and money as well,—two hundred roubles, it's
said!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SECOND NEIGHBOUR.</span> That's all very well, but even money
can't give much pleasure in the face of such a disgrace.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST NEIGHBOUR.</span> Hush!… There's his father, I think.</p>

<p><i>They cease talking, and go into the hut.</i></p>

<p><i>The Suitor's Father comes out of the hut hiccoughing.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">THE FATHER.</span> Oh, I'm all in a sweat. It's awfully hot!
Will just cool myself a bit. [<i>Stands puffing</i>] The Lord only
knows what—something is not right. I can't feel happy.—Well,
it's the old woman's affair.</p>

<p><i>Enter Matryóna from hut.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> And I was just thinking, where's the father?
Where's the father? And here you are, dear friend.…
Well, dear friend, the Lord be thanked! Everything is
as honourable as can be! When one's arranging a match
one should not boast. And I have never learnt to boast.
But as you've come about the right business, so with the
Lord's help, you'll be grateful to me all your life! She's
a wonderful girl! There's no other like her in all the
district!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THE FATHER.</span> That's true enough, but how about the
money?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Don't you trouble about the money! All
she had from her father goes with her. And it's more
than one gets easily, as things are nowadays. Three
times fifty roubles!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THE FATHER.</span> We don't complain, but it's for our own
child. Naturally we want to get the best we can.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> I'll tell you straight, friend: if it hadn't
been for me, you'd never have found anything like her!
They've had an offer from the Karmílins, but I stood out
against it. And as for the money, I'll tell you truly:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>when her father, God be merciful to his soul, was dying,
he gave orders that the widow should take Nikíta into
the homestead—of course I know all about it from my
son,—and the money was to go to Akoulína. Why, another
one might have thought of his own interests, but Nikíta
gives everything clean! It's no trifle. Fancy what a sum
it is!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THE FATHER.</span> People are saying, that more money was
left her? The lad's sharp too!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Oh, dear soul alive! A slice in another's
hand always looks big; all she had will be handed over.
I tell you, throw doubts to the wind and make all sure!
What a girl she is! as fresh as a daisy!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THE FATHER.</span> That's so. But my old woman and I
were only wondering about the girl; why has she not
come out? We've been thinking, suppose she's sickly?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Oh, ah.… Who? She? Sickly? Why,
there's none to compare with her in the district. The
girl's as sound as a bell; you can't pinch her. But you
saw her the other day! And as for work, she's wonderful!
She's a bit deaf, that's true, but there are spots on the
sun, you know. And her not coming out, you see, it's
from an evil eye! A spell's been cast on her! And I
know the bitch who's done the business! They know of
the betrothal and they bewitched her. But I know a
counter-spell. The girl will get up to-morrow. Don't
you worry about the girl!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THE FATHER.</span> Well, of course, the thing's settled.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Yes, of course! Don't you turn back. And
don't forget me, I've had a lot of trouble. Don't forget …</p>

<p><i>A woman's voice from the hut.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">VOICE.</span> If we are to go, let's go. Come along, Iván!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THE FATHER.</span> I'm coming. [<i>Exeunt. Guests crowd together
in the passage and prepare to go away</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN</span> [<i>runs out of the hut and calls to Anísya</i>] Mother!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
<span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>from inside</i>] What d'you want?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Mother, come here, or they'll hear.</p>

<p><i>Anísya enters and they go together to the shed.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Well? What is it? Where's Akoulína?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> She's gone into the barn. It's awful what's she's
doing there! I'm blest! “I can't bear it,” she says.
“I'll scream,” she says, “I'll scream out loud.” Blest
if she didn't.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> She'll have to wait. We'll see our visitors off
first.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Oh mother! She's so bad! And she's angry
too. “What's the good of their drinking my health?”
she says. “I shan't marry,” she says. “I shall die,”
she says. Mother, supposing she does die! It's awful.
I'm so frightened!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> No fear, she'll not die. But don't you go near
her. Come along. [<i>Exit Anísya and Nan</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH</span> [<i>comes in at the gate and begins collecting the
scattered hay</i>] Oh Lord! Merciful Nicholas! What a lot
of liquor they've been and swilled, and the smell they've
made! It smells even out here! But no, I don't want
any, drat it! See how they've scattered the hay about.
They don't eat it, but only trample it under foot. A truss
gone before you know it. Oh, that smell, it seems to be
just under my nose! Drat it! [<i>Yawns</i>] It's time to go to
sleep! But I don't care to go into the hut. It seems
to float just round my nose! It has a strong scent, the
damned stuff! [<i>The guests are heard driving off</i>] They're
off at last. Oh Lord! Merciful Nicholas! There they
go, binding themselves and gulling one another. And it's
all gammon!</p>

<p><i>Enter Nikíta.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Mítritch, you get off to sleep and I'll put this
straight.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> All right, you throw it to the sheep. Well,
have you seen 'em all off?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
<span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Yes, they're off! But things are not right! I
don't know what to do!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> It's a fine mess. But there's the Foundlings'<a name="FNanchor_6_6" href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor_6_6">[6]</a>
for that sort of thing. Whoever likes may drop one
there; they'll take 'em all. Give 'em as many as you
like, they ask no questions, and even pay—if the mother
goes in as a wet-nurse. It's easy enough nowadays.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> But mind, Mítritch, don't go blabbing.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> It's no concern of mine. Cover the tracks as
you think best. Dear me, how you smell of liquor! I'll
go in. Oh Lord! [<i>Exit, yawning</i>].</p>

<p><i>Nikíta is long silent. Sits down on a sledge.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Here's a go!</p>

<p><i>Enter Anísya.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Where are you?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Here.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> What are you doing there? There's no time to
be lost! We must take it out directly!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> What are we to do?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> I'll tell you what you are to do. And you'll
have to do it!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> You'd better take it to the Foundlings'—if anything.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Then you'd better take it there yourself if you
like! You've a hankering for smut, but you're weak
when it comes to settling up, I see!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> What's to be done?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Go down into the cellar, I tell you, and dig a
hole!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Couldn't you manage, somehow, some other way?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>imitating him</i>] “Some other way?” Seems we
can't “some other way!” You should have thought about
it a year ago. Do what you're told to!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Oh dear, what a go!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
<i>Enter Nan.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Mother! Grandmother's calling! I think sister's
got a baby! I'm blest if it didn't scream!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> What are you babbling about? Plague take
you! It's kittens whining there. Go into the hut and
sleep, or I'll give it you!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Mammy dear, truly, I swear …</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>raising her arm as if to strike</i>] I'll give it you!
You be off and don't let me catch sight of you! [<i>Nan
runs into hut. To Nikíta</i>] Do as you're told, or else mind!
[<i>Exit</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>alone. After a long silence</i>] Here's a go! Oh
these women! What a fix! Says you should have thought
of it a year ago. When's one to think beforehand?
When's one to think? Why, last year this Anísya dangled
after me. What was I to do? Am I a monk? The
master died; and I covered my sin as was proper, so I was
not to blame there. Aren't there lots of such cases?
And then those powders. Did I put her up to that?
Why, had I known what the bitch was up to, I'd have
killed her! I'm sure I should have killed her! She's
made me her partner in these horrors—that jade! And
she became loathsome to me from that day! She became
loathsome, loathsome to me as soon as mother told me
about it. I can't bear the sight of her! Well then, how
could I live with her? And then it begun.… That
wench began hanging round. Well, what was I to
do! If I had not done it, someone else would. And
this is what comes of it! Still I'm not to blame in this
either. Oh, what a go! [<i>Sits thinking</i>] They are bold,
these women! What a plan to think of! But I won't
have a hand in it!</p>

<p><i>Enter Matryóna with a lantern and spade, panting.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Why are you sitting there like a hen on
a perch? What did your wife tell you to do? You just
get things ready!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
<span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> What do you mean to do?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> We know what to do. You do your share!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> You'll be getting me into a mess!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> What? You're not thinking of backing out,
are you? Now it's come to this, and you back out!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Think what a thing it would be! It's a living
soul.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> A living soul indeed! Why, it's more dead
than alive. And what's one to do with it? Go and take
it to the Foundlings'—it will die just the same, and the
rumour will get about, and people will talk, and the girl be
left on our hands.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> And supposing it's found out?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Not manage to do it in one's own house?
We'll manage it so that no one will have an inkling. Only
do as I tell you. We women can't do it without a man.
There, take the spade, and get it done there,—I'll hold
the light.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> What am I to get done?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> [<i>in a low voice</i>] Dig a hole; then we'll bring
it out and get it out of the way in a trice! There, she's
calling again. Now then, get in, and I'll go.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Is it dead then?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Of course it is. Only you must be quick, or
else people will notice! They'll see or they'll hear! The
rascals must needs know everything. And the policeman
went by this evening. Well then, you see [<i>gives him the
spade</i>], you get down into the cellar and dig a hole right
in the corner; the earth is soft there, and you'll smooth
it over. Mother earth will not blab to any one; she'll
keep it close. Go then; go, dear.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> You'll get me into a mess, bother you! I'll go
away! You do it alone as best you can!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>through the doorway</i>] Well? Has he dug it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Why have you come away? What have
you done with it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
<span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> I've covered it with rags. No one can hear it.
Well, has he dug it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> He doesn't want to!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>springs out enraged</i>] Doesn't want to! How
will he like feeding vermin in prison! I'll go straight
away and tell everything to the police! It's all the same
if one must perish. I'll go straight and tell!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>taken aback</i>] What will you tell?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> What? Everything! Who took the money?
You! [<i>Nikíta is silent</i>] And who gave the poison? I did!
But you knew! You knew! You knew! We were in
agreement!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> That's enough now. Nikíta dear, why are
you obstinate? What's to be done now? One must take
some trouble. Go, honey.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> See the fine gentleman! He doesn't like it!
You've put upon me long enough! You've trampled me
under foot! Now it's my turn! Go, I tell you, or else I'll
do what I said.… There, take the spade; there, now go!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Drat you! Can't you leave a fellow alone! [<i>Takes
the spade, but shrinks</i>] If I don't choose to, I'll not go!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Not go? [<i>Begins to shout</i>] Neighbours! Heh!
heh!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> [<i>closes her mouth</i>] What are you about? You're
mad! He'll go.… Go, sonnie; go, my own.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> I'll cry murder!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Now stop! Oh what people! You'd better be
quick.… As well be hung for a sheep as a lamb! [<i>Goes
towards the cellar</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Yes, that's just it, honey. If you know how
to amuse yourself, you must know how to hide the consequences.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>still excited</i>] He's trampled on me … he and
his slut! But it's enough! I'm not going to be the
only one! Let him also be a murderer! Then he'll
know how it feels!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
<span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> There, there! How she flares up! Don't
you be cross, lass, but do things quietly little by little, as
it's best. You go to the girl, and he'll do the work.
[<i>Follows Nikíta to the cellar with a lantern. He descends
into the cellar</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> And I'll make him strangle his dirty brat! [<i>Still
excited</i>] I've worried myself to death all alone, with Peter's
bones weighing on my mind! Let him feel it too! I'll
not spare myself; I've said I'll not spare myself!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>from the cellar</i>] Show a light!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> [<i>holds up the lantern to him. To Anísya</i>] He's
digging. Go and bring it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> You stay with him, or he'll go away, the wretch!
And I'll go and bring it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Mind, don't forget to baptize it, or I will
if you like. Have you a cross?</p>

<p><a name="end-act4" id="end-act4"><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span></a> I'll find one. I know how to do it. [<i>Exit</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> How the woman bristled up! But one
must allow she's been put upon. Well, but with the Lord's
help, when we've covered this business, there'll be an
end of it. We'll shove the girl off without any trouble.
My son will live in comfort. The house, thank God, is
as full as an egg. They'll not forget me either. Where
would they have been without Matryóna? They'd not
have known how to contrive things. [<i>Peering into the
cellar</i>] Is it ready, sonnie?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>puts out his head</i>] What are you about there?
Bring it quick! What are you dawdling for? If it is to
be done, let it be done.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> [<i>goes towards door of the hut and meets Anísya.

you baptized it?</p>

<span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Why, of course! It was all I could do to take

It's alive! What am I to …</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>snatches the baby from him and throws it into the

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> [<i>sits on the doorstep of the hut</i>] He's tender-hearted.
It's hard on him, poor dear. Well, what of
that? Isn't it also his sin?</p>

<p><i>Anísya stands by the cellar.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> [<i>sits looking at her and discourses</i>] Oh, oh, oh!
How frightened he was: well, but what of that? If it <em>is</em>
hard, it's the only thing to be done. Where was one to put
it? And just think, how often it happens that people pray
to God to have children! But no, God gives them none; or
they are all still-born. Look at our priest's wife now.…
And here, where it's not wanted, here it lives. [<i>Looks towards
the cellar</i>] I suppose he's finished. [<i>To Anísya</i>] Well?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>looking into the cellar</i>] He's put a board on it

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Oh, oh! One would be glad not to sin,
but what's one to do?</p>

mind, it will pass!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> What have they made me do? What have
they made me do? How it whimpered.… How it
crunched under me! What have they done with me?…
And it's really alive, still alive! [<i>Listens in silence</i>]
It's whimpering … There, it's whimpering. [<i>Runs to the

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> [<i>to Anísya</i>] He's going; it seems he means

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>does not heed her, but listens by the cellar door</i>]

can it be? Mother! Mother, I say! [<i>Goes up to her</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> What is it, sonnie?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Mother, my own mother, I can't do any more!

Come, come, drink a drop to give you courage!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Mother, mother! It seems my time has come!
What have you done with me? How the little bones
crunched, and how it whimpered! My own mother! What
have you done with me? [<i>Steps aside and sits down on the
sledge</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Come, my own, have a drink! It certainly
does seem uncanny at night-time. But wait a bit. When
the day breaks, you know, and one day and another
passes, you'll forget even to think of it. Wait a bit; when
the girl's married we'll even forget to think of it. But
you go and have a drink; have a drink! I'll go and put

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> And what of him?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> He's so frightened! You've been too hard
with him. Leave him alone, he'll come to his senses.
God help him! I'll set to work myself. Put the lantern
down here. I can see.</p>

<p><i>Matryóna disappears into the cellar.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>looking towards the door by which Nikíta entered

<p class="scene">The interior of the hut as in <a href="#act1">Act I</a>.</p>

<p class="scene">Nan lies on the bench, and is covered with a coat. Mítritch
is sitting on the oven smoking.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Dear me! How they've made the place
smell! Drat 'em! They've been spilling the fine stuff.
Even tobacco don't get rid of the smell! It keeps tickling
one's nose so. Oh Lord! But it's bedtime, I guess.
[<i>Approaches the lamp to put it out</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN</span> [<i>jumps up, and remains sitting up</i>] Daddy dear,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor_7_7">[7]</a>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Not put it out? Why?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Didn't you hear them making a row in the yard?
[<i>Listens</i>] D'you hear, there in the barn again now?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> What's that to you? I guess no one's asked
you to mind! Lie down and sleep! And I'll turn down
the light. [<i>Turns down lamp</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Daddy darling! Don't put it right out; leave a
little bit if only as big as a mouse's eye, else it's so
frightening!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH</span> [<i>laughs</i>] All right, all right. [<i>Sits down by her</i>]
What's there to be afraid of?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
<span class="speaker">NAN.</span> How can one help being frightened, daddy!
Sister did go on so! She was beating her head against
the box! [<i>Whispers</i>] You know, I know … a little baby
is going to be born.… It's already born, I think.…</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Eh, what a little busybody it is! May the
frogs kick her! Must needs know everything. Lie down
and sleep! [<i>Nan lies down</i>] That's right! [<i>Tucks her up</i>]
That's right! There now, if you know too much you'll
grow old too soon.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> And you are going to lie on the oven?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Well, of course! What a little silly you are,
now I come to look at you! Must needs know everything.
[<i>Tucks her up again, then stands up to go</i>] There now, lie
still and sleep! [<i>Goes up to the oven</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> It gave just one cry, and now there's nothing to
be heard.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Oh Lord! Gracious Nicholas! What is it
you can't hear?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> The baby.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> There is none, that's why you can't hear it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> But I heard it! Blest if I didn't hear it! Such
a thin voice!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Heard indeed! Much you heard! Well, if
you know,—why then it was just such a little girl as you
that the bogey popped into his bag and made off with.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> What bogey?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Why, just his very self! [<i>Climbs up on to the
oven</i>] The oven is beautifully warm to-night. Quite a
treat! Oh Lord! Gracious Nicholas!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Daddy! are you going to sleep?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> What else? Do you think I'm going to sing
songs?</p>

<p><i>Silence.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Daddy! Daddy, I say! They are digging! they're
digging—don't you hear? Blest if they're not, they're
digging!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
<span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> What are you dreaming about? Digging!
Digging in the night! Who's digging? The cow's rubbing
herself, that's all. Digging indeed! Go to sleep
I tell you, else I'll just put out the light!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Daddy darling, don't put it out! I won't …
truly, truly, I won't. It's so frightful!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Frightful? Don't be afraid and then it won't
be frightful. Look at her, she's afraid, and then says it's
frightful. How can it help being frightful if you are
afraid? Eh, what a stupid little girl!</p>

<p><i>Silence. The cricket chirps.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN</span> [<i>whispers</i>] Daddy! I say, daddy! Are you
asleep?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Now then, what d'you want?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> What's the bogey like?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Why, like this! When he finds such a one
as you, who won't sleep, he comes with a sack and pops
the girl into it, then in he gets himself, head and all,
lifts her dress, and gives her a fine whipping!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> What with?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> He takes a birch-broom with him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> But he can't see there—inside the sack!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> He'll see, no fear!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> But I'll bite him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> No, friend, him you can't bite!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Daddy, there's some one coming! Who is it? Oh
gracious goodness! Who can it be?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Well, if some one's coming, let them come!
What's the matter with you? I suppose it's your mother!</p>

<p><i>Enter Anísya.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Nan! [<i>Nan pretends to be asleep</i>] Mítritch!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> What's the lamp burning for? We are going
to sleep in the summer-hut.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Why, you see I've only just got straight. I'll
put the light out all right.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Why, what is it you are looking for?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> I'm looking for a cross. Suppose it were to die
unbaptized! It would be a sin, you know!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Of course it would! Everything in due

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Yes, I've found it. [<i>Exit</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> That's right, else I'd have lent her mine.
Oh Lord!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN</span> [<i>jumps up trembling</i>] Oh, oh, daddy! Don't go to
sleep; for goodness' sake, don't! It's so frightful!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> What's frightful?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> It will die—the little baby will! At Aunt Irene's
the old woman also baptized the baby, and it died!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> If it dies, they'll bury it!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> But maybe it wouldn't have died, only old Granny
Matryóna's there! Didn't I hear what granny was saying?
I heard her! Blest if I didn't!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> What did you hear? Go to sleep, I tell
you. Cover yourself up, head and all, and let's have an
end of it!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> If it lived, I'd nurse it!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH</span> [<i>roars</i>] Oh Lord!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Where will they put it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> In the right place! It's no business of yours!
Go to sleep I tell you, else mother will come; she'll give
it you! [<i>Silence</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Daddy! Eh, daddy! That girl, you know, you
were telling about—they didn't kill her?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> That girl? Oh yes. That girl turned out all
right!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> How was it? You were saying you found her?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Well, we just found her!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> But where did you find her? Do tell!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Why, in their own house; that's where! We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>came to a village, the soldiers began hunting about in the
house, when suddenly there's that same little girl lying
on the floor, flat on her stomach. We were going to give
her a knock on the head, but all at once I felt that sorry,
that I took her up in my arms; but no, she wouldn't let
me! Made herself so heavy, quite a hundredweight,
and caught hold where she could with her hands, so that
one couldn't get them off! Well, so I began stroking her
head. It was so bristly,—just like a hedgehog! So I
stroked and stroked, and she quieted down at last. I
soaked a bit of rusk and gave it her. She understood
that, and began nibbling. What were we to do with her?
We took her; took her, and began feeding and feeding
her, and she got so used to us that we took her with us on
the march, and so she went about with us. Ah, she was
a fine girl!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Yes, and not baptized?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Who can tell! They used to say, not altogether.
'Cos why, those people weren't our own.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Germans?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> What an idea! Germans! Not Germans,
but Asiatics. They are just the same as Jews, but still
not Jews. Polish, yet Asiatics. Curls … or, Curdlys
is their name.… I've forgotten what it is!<a name="FNanchor_8_8" href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor_8_8">[8]</a> We
called the girl Sáshka. She was a fine girl, Sáshka was!
There now, I've forgotten everything I used to know!
But that girl—the deuce take her—seems to be before
my eyes now! Out of all my time of service, I remember
how they flogged me, and I remember that girl. That's all
I remember! She'd hang round one's neck, and one
'ud carry her so. That was a girl,—if you wanted a
better you'd not find one! We gave her away afterwards.
The captain's wife took her to bring up as her
daughter. So—she was all right! How sorry the soldiers
were to let her go!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
<span class="speaker">NAN.</span> There now, daddy, and I remember when father
was dying,—you were not living with us then. Well, he
called Nikíta and says, “Forgive me, Nikíta!” he says,
and begins to cry. [<i>Sighs</i>] That also felt very sad!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Yes; there now, so it is …</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Daddy! Daddy, I say! There they are again,
making a noise in the cellar! Oh gracious heavens! Oh
dear! Oh dear! Oh, daddy! They'll do something to it!
They'll make away with it, and it's so little! Oh, oh!
[<i>Covers up her head and cries</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH</span> [<i>listening</i>] Really they're up to some villainy,
blow them to shivers! Oh, these women are vile creatures!
One can't say much for men either; but women!…
They are like wild beasts, and stick at nothing!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN</span> [<i>rising</i>] Daddy; I say, daddy!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Well, what now?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> The other day a traveller stayed the night; he
said that when an infant died its soul goes up straight to
heaven. Is that true?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Who can tell. I suppose so. Well?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Oh, it would be best if I died too. [<i>Whimpers</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Then you'd be off the list!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Up to ten one's an infant, and maybe one's soul
would go to God. Else one's sure to go to the bad!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> And how to the bad? How should the likes
of you not go to the bad? Who teaches you? What do
you see? What do you hear? Only vileness! I, though
I've not been taught much, still know a thing or two.
I'm not quite like a peasant woman. A peasant woman,
what is she? Just mud! There are many millions of the
likes of you in Russia, and all as blind as moles—knowing
nothing! All sorts of spells: how to stop the cattle-plague
with a plough, and how to cure children by putting
them under the perches in the hen-house! That's
what they know!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Yes, mother also did that!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
<span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Yes,—there it is,—just so! So many millions
of girls and women, and all like beasts in a forest! As she
grows up, so she dies! Never sees anything; never hears
anything. A peasant,—he may learn something at the
pub, or maybe in prison, or in the army,—as I did. But a
woman? Let alone about God, she doesn't even know
rightly what Friday it is! Friday! Friday! But ask her
what's Friday? She don't know! They're like blind
puppies, creeping about and poking their noses into
the dung-heap.… All they know are their silly songs.
Ho, ho, ho, ho! But what they mean by ho-ho, they
don't know themselves!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> But I, daddy, I do know half the Lord's Prayer!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> A lot you know! But what can one expect
of you? Who teaches you? Only a tipsy peasant—with
the strap perhaps! That's all the teaching you get! I
don't know who'll have to answer for you. For a recruit,
the drill-sergeant or the corporal has to answer; but for
the likes of you there's no one responsible! Just as the
cattle that have no herdsman are the most mischievous, so
with you women—you are the stupidest class! The most
foolish class is yours!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Then what's one to do?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> That's what one has to do.… You just
cover up your head and sleep! Oh Lord!</p>

<p><i>Silence. The cricket chirps.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN</span> [<i>jumps up</i>] Daddy! Some one's screaming awfully!
Blest if some one isn't screaming! Daddy darling, it's
coming here!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Cover up your head, I tell you!</p>

<p><i>Enter Nikíta, followed by Matryóna.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> What have they done with me? What have
they done with me?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Have a drop, honey; have a drop of drink!
What's the matter? [<i>Fetches the spirits and sets the bottle
before him</i>].</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
<span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Give it here! Perhaps the drink will help me!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Mind! They're not asleep! Here you are,
have a drop!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> What does it all mean? Why did you plan
it? You might have taken it somewhere!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> [<i>whispers</i>] Sit still a bit and drink a little
more, or have a smoke. It will ease your thoughts!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> My own mother! My turn seems to have come!
How it began to whimper, and how the little bones
crunched … krr … I'm not a man now!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Eh, now, what's the use of talking so silly!
Of course it does seem fearsome at night, but wait till the
daylight comes, and a day or two passes, and you'll forget
to think of it! [<i>Goes up to Nikíta and puts her hand on his
shoulder</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Go away from me! What have you done with
me?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Come, come, sonnie! Now really, what's
the matter with you? [<i>Takes his hand</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Go away from me! I'll kill you! It's all one
to me now! I'll kill you!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Oh, oh, how frightened he's got! You
should go and have a sleep now!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> I have nowhere to go; I'm lost!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> [<i>shaking her head</i>] Oh, oh, I'd better go and
tidy things up. He'll sit and rest a bit, and it will pass!
[<i>Exit</i>].</p>

<p><i>Nikíta sits with his face in his hands. Mítritch and Nan
seem stunned.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> It's whining! It's whining! It is really—there,
there, quite plain! She'll bury it, really she will! [<i>Runs
to the door</i>] Mother, don't bury it, it's alive.…</p>

<p><i>Enter Matryóna.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> [<i>whispers</i>] Now then, what is it? Heaven
help you! Why won't you get to rest? How can it be
alive? All its bones are crushed!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
<span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Give me more drink! [<i>Drinks</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Now go, sonnie. You'll fall asleep now all
right.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>stands listening</i>] Still alive … there … it's
whining! Don't you hear?… There!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> [<i>whispers</i>] No! I tell you!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Mother! My own mother! I've ruined my
life! What have you done with me? Where am I to go?
[<i>Runs out of the hut; Matryóna follows him</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Daddy dear, darling, they've smothered it!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH</span> [<i>angrily</i>] Go to sleep, I tell you! Oh dear,
may the frogs kick you! I'll give it to you with the broom!
Go to sleep, I tell you!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Daddy, my treasure! Something is catching hold
of my shoulders, something is catching hold with its paws!
Daddy dear … really, really … I must go! Daddy,
darling! let me get up on the oven with you! Let me,
for Heaven's sake! Catching hold … catching hold!
Oh! [<i>Runs to the stove</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> See how they've frightened the girl.…
What vile creatures they are! May the frogs kick them!
Well then, climb up.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN</span> [<i>climbs on oven</i>] But don't you go away!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Where should I go to? Climb up, climb
up! Oh Lord! Gracious Nicholas! Holy Mother!…
How they have frighted the girl. [<i>Covers her up</i>] There's
a little fool—really a little fool! How they've frighted
her; really, they are vile creatures! The deuce take
'em!</p>

<h2>ACT V</h2>


<h3 class="smcap"><ins title="Scene 1">Scene 1.</ins></h3>

<p class="scene">In front of scene a stack-stand, to the left a thrashing ground,
to the right a barn. The barn doors are open. Straw is
strewn about in the doorway. The hut with yard and out-buildings
is seen in the background, whence proceed sounds of
singing and of a tambourine. Two Girls are walking past the
barn towards the hut.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST GIRL.</span> There, you see we've managed to pass without
so much as getting our boots dirty! But to come by
the street is terribly muddy! [<i>Stop and wipe their boots on
the straw. First Girl looks at the straw and sees something</i>]
What's that?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SECOND GIRL</span> [<i>looks where the straw lies and sees some one</i>]
It's Mítritch, their labourer. Just look how drunk he is!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST GIRL.</span> Why, I thought he didn't drink.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SECOND GIRL.</span> It seems he didn't, until it was going
around.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST GIRL.</span> Just see! He must have come to fetch
some straw. Look! he's got a rope in his hand, and he's
fallen asleep.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SECOND GIRL</span> [<i>listening</i>] They're still singing the praises.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor_9_9">[9]</a>
So I s'pose the bride and bridegroom have not yet been
blessed! They say Akoulína didn't even lament!<a name="FNanchor_10_10" href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor_10_10">[10]</a></p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST GIRL.</span> Mammie says she is marrying against her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>will. Her stepfather threatened her, or else she'd not
have done it for the world! Why, you know what they've
been saying about her?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARÍNA</span> [<i>catching up the Girls</i>] How d'you do, lassies?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GIRLS.</span> How d'you do?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARÍNA.</span> Going to the wedding, my dears?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST GIRL.</span> It's nearly over! We've come just to have
a look.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARÍNA.</span> Would you call my old man for me? Simon,
from Zoúevo; but surely you know him?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST GIRL.</span> To be sure we do; he's a relative of the
bridegroom's, I think?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARÍNA.</span> Of course; he's my old man's nephew, the
bridegroom is.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SECOND GIRL.</span> Why don't you go yourself? Fancy not
going to a wedding!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARÍNA.</span> I have no mind for it, and no time either. It's
time for us to be going home. We didn't mean to come
to the wedding. We were taking oats to town. We only
stopped to feed the horse, and they made my old man
go in.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST GIRL.</span> Where did you put up then? At Fyódoritch's?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARÍNA.</span> Yes. Well then, I'll stay here and you go and
call him, my dear—my old man. Call him, my pet, and
say “Your missis, Marína, says you must go now!” His
mates are harnessing.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST GIRL.</span> Well, all right—if you won't go in yourself.</p>

<p><i>The Girls go away towards the house along a footpath.
Sounds of songs and tambourine.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARÍNA</span> [<i>alone, stands thinking</i>] I might go in, but I don't
like to, because I have not met him since that day he
threw me over. It's more than a year now. But I'd
have liked to have a peep and see how he lives with his
Anísya. People say they don't get on. She's a coarse
woman, and with a character of her own. I should think
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>he's remembered me more than once. He's been caught
by the idea of a comfortable life and has changed me for
it. But, God help him, I don't cherish ill-will! Then
it hurt! Oh dear, it was pain! But now it's worn
away and been forgotten. But I'd like to have seen him.
[<i>Looks towards hut and sees Nikíta</i>] Look there! Why, he
is coming here! Have the girls told him? How's it he
has left his guests? I'll go away! [<i>Nikíta approaches,
hanging his head down, swinging his arms, and muttering</i>]
And how sullen he looks!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>sees and recognises Marína</i>] Marína, dearest
friend, little Marína, what do you want?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARÍNA.</span> I have come for my old man.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Why didn't you come to the wedding? You
might have had a look round, and a laugh at my expense!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARÍNA.</span> What have I to laugh at? I've come for my
husband.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Ah, Marína dear! [<i>Tries to embrace her</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARÍNA</span> [<i>steps angrily aside</i>] You'd better drop that sort
of thing, Nikíta! What has been, is past! I've come for
my husband. Is he in your house?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> So I must not remember the past? You won't
let me?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARÍNA.</span> It's no use recalling the past! What used to
be is over now!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> And can never come back, you mean?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARÍNA.</span> And will never come back! But why have
you gone away? You, the master,—and to go away from
the feast!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>sits down on the straw</i>] Why have I gone away?
Eh, if you knew, if you had any idea … I'm dull,
Marína, so dull that I wish my eyes would not see! I
rose from the table and left them, to get away from the
people. If I could only avoid seeing any one!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARÍNA</span> [<i>coming nearer to him</i>] How's that?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> This is how it is: when I eat, it's there! When
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>I drink, it's there! When I sleep, it's there! I'm so sick of
it—so sick! But it's chiefly because I'm all alone that I'm
so sick, little Marína. I have no one to share my trouble.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARÍNA.</span> You can't live your life without trouble, Nikíta.
However, I've wept over mine and wept it away.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> The former, the old trouble! Ah, dear friend,
you've wept yours away, and I've got mine up to there!
[<i>Puts his hand to his throat</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARÍNA.</span> But why?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Why, I'm sick of my whole life! I am sick of
myself! Ah, Marína, why did you not know how to
keep me? You've ruined me, and yourself too! Is this
life?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARÍNA</span> [<i>stands by the barn crying, but restrains herself</i>] I
do not complain of my life, Nikíta! God grant every one
a life like mine. I do not complain. I confessed to my
old man at the time, and he forgave me. And he does
not reproach me. I'm not discontented with my life. The
old man is quiet, and is fond of me, and I keep his children
clothed and washed! He is really kind to me. Why
should I complain? It seems God willed it so. And
what's the matter with your life? You are rich …</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> My life!… It's only that I don't wish to disturb
the wedding feast, or I'd take this rope here [<i>takes
hold of the rope on the straw</i>] and throw it across that rafter
there. Then I'd make a noose and stretch it out, and I'd
climb on to that rafter and jump down with my head in
the noose! That's what my life is!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARÍNA.</span> That's enough! Lord help you!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> You think I'm joking? You think I'm drunk?
I'm not drunk! To-day even drink takes no hold on me!
I'm devoured by misery! Misery is eating me up completely,
so that I care for nothing! Oh, little Marína, it's
only with you I ever lived! Do you remember how we
used to while away the nights together at the railway?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARÍNA.</span> Don't you rub the sores, Nikíta! I'm bound
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>legally now, and you too. My sin has been forgiven, don't
disturb …</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> What shall I do with my heart? Where am I
to turn to?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARÍNA.</span> What's there to be done? You've got a wife.
Don't go looking at others, but keep to your own! You
loved Anísya, then go on loving her!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Oh, that Anísya, she's gall and wormwood to
me, but she's round my feet like rank weeds!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARÍNA.</span> Whatever she is, still she's your wife.…
But what's the use of talking; you'd better go to your
visitors, and send my husband to me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Oh dear, if you knew the whole business …
but there's no good talking!</p>

<p><i>Enter Marína's husband, red and tipsy, and Nan.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARÍNA'S HUSBAND.</span> Marína! Missis! My old woman!
are you here?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> There's your husband calling you. Go!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARÍNA.</span> And you?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> I? I'll lie down here for a bit! [<i>Lies down on
the straw</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">HUSBAND.</span> Where is she then?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> There she is, near the barn.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">HUSBAND.</span> What are you standing there for? Come to
the feast! The hosts want you to come and do them
honour! The wedding party is just going to start, and
then we can go too.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARÍNA</span> [<i>going towards her husband</i>] I didn't want to
go in.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">HUSBAND.</span> Come on, I tell you! You'll drink a glass to
our nephew Peter's health, the rascal! Else the hosts
might take offence! There's plenty of time for our
business. [<i>Marína's husband puts his arm around her, and
goes reeling out with her</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>rises and sits down on the straw</i>] Ah, now that I've
seen her, life seems more sickening than ever! It was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>only with her that I ever really lived! I've ruined my
life for nothing! I've done for myself! [<i>Lies down</i>] Where
can I go? If mother earth would but open and swallow
me!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN</span> [<i>sees Nikíta, and runs towards him</i>] Daddy, I say,
daddy! They're looking for you! Her godfather and
all of them have already blessed her. Truly they have,
they're getting cross!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>aside</i>] Where can I go to?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> What? What are you saying?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> I'm not saying anything! Don't bother!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Daddy! Come, I say! [<i>Nikíta is silent, Nan pulls him
by the hand</i>] Dad, go and bless them! My word, they're
angry, they're grumbling!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>drags away his hand</i>] Leave me alone!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Now then!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>threatens her with the rope</i>] Go, I say! I'll give
it you!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Then I'll send mother! [<i>Runs away</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>rises</i>] How can I go? How can I take the
holy icón in my hands? How am I to look her in
the face! [<i>Lies down again</i>] Oh, if there were a hole in the
ground, I'd jump in! No one should see me, and I should
see no one! [<i>Rises again</i>] No, I shan't go … May they
all go to the devil, I shan't go! [<i>Takes the rope and makes
a noose, and tries it on his neck</i>] That's the way!</p>

<p><i>Enter Matryóna. Nikíta sees his mother, takes the rope
off his neck, and again lies down in the straw.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> [<i>comes in hurriedly</i>] Nikíta! Nikíta, I say!
He don't even answer! Nikíta, what's the matter? Have
you had a drop too much? Come, Nikíta dear; come,
honey! The people are tired of waiting.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Oh dear, what have you done with me? I'm a
lost man!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> But what is the matter then? Come, my
own; come, give them your blessing, as is proper and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>honourable, and then it'll all be over! Why, the people
are waiting!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> How can I give blessings?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Why, in the usual way! Don't you know?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> I know, I know! But who is it I am to bless?
What have I done to her?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> What have you done? Eh, now he's going
to remember it! Why, who knows anything about it?
Not a soul! And the girl is going of her own accord.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Yes, but how?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Because she's afraid, of course. But still
she's going. Besides, what's to be done now? She should
have thought sooner! Now she can't refuse. And his
kinsfolk can't take offence either. They saw the girl
twice, and get money with her too! It's all safe and
sound!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Yes, but what's in the cellar?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> [<i>laughs</i>] In the cellar? Why, cabbages, mushrooms,
potatoes, I suppose! Why remember the past?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> I'd be only too glad to forget it; but I can't!
When I let my mind go, it's just as if I heard.… Oh,
what have you done with me?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Now, what are you humbugging for?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>turns face downward</i>] Mother! Don't torment me!
I've got it up to there! [<i>Puts his hand to his throat</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Still it has to be done! As it is, people are
talking. “The master's gone away and won't come; he
can't make up his mind to give his blessing.” They'll be
putting two and two together. As soon as they see you're
frightened they'll begin guessing. “The thief none suspect
who walks bold and erect!” But you'll be getting out of
the frying-pan into the fire! Above all, lad, don't show
it; don't lose courage, else they'll find out all the
more!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Oh dear! You have snared me into a trap!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> That'll do, I tell you; come along! Come in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>and give your blessing, as is right and honourable;—and
there's an end of the matter!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>lies face down</i>] I can't!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> [<i>aside</i>] What has come over him? He seemed
all right, and suddenly this comes over him! It seems
he's bewitched! Get up, Nikíta! See! There's Anísya
coming; she's left her guests!</p>

<p><i>Anísya enters, dressed up, red and tipsy.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Oh, how nice it is, mother! So nice, so respectable!
And how the people are pleased.… But where
is he?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Here, honey, he's here; he's laid down on
the straw and there he lies! He won't come!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>looking at his wife</i>] Just see, she's tipsy too!
When I look at her my heart seems to turn! How can
one live with her? [<i>Turns on his face</i>] I'll kill her some
day! It'll be worse then!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Only look, how he's got all among the straw!
Is it the drink? [<i>Laughs</i>] I'd not mind lying down there
with you, but I've no time! Come, I'll lead you! It is
so nice in the house! It's a treat to look on! A concertina!
And the women singing so well! All tipsy!
Everything so respectable, so nice!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> What's nice?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> The wedding—such a jolly wedding! They all
say it's quite an uncommon fine wedding! All so respectable,
so nice! Come along! We'll go together! I have
had a drop, but I can give you a hand yet! [<i>Takes his
hand</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>pulls it back with disgust</i>] Go alone! I'll come!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> What are you humbugging for? We've got rid
of all the bother, we've got rid of her as came between
us; now we have nothing to do but to live and be merry!
And all so respectable, and quite legal! I'm so pleased!
I have no words for it! It's just as if I were going to
marry you over again! And oh, the people, they <em>are</em>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>pleased! They're all thanking us! And the guests are
all of the best: <ins title="Ivan">Iván</ins> Moséitch is there, and the Police
Officer; they've also been singing songs of praise!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Then you should have stayed with them! What
have you come for?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> True enough, I must go back! Else what does
it look like! The hosts both go and leave the visitors!
And the guests are all of the best!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>gets up and brushes the straw off himself</i>] Go, and
I'll come at once!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Just see! He listens to the young bird, but
wouldn't listen to the old one! He would not hear me,
but he follows his wife at once! [<i>Matryóna and Anísya
turn to go</i>] Well, are you coming?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> I'll come directly! You go and I'll follow! I'll
come and give my blessing! [<i>The women stop</i>] Go on! I'll
follow! Now then, go! [<i>Exit women. Sits down and takes
his boots off</i>] Yes, I'm going! A likely thing! No, you'd
better look at the rafter for me! I'll fix the noose and
jump with it from the rafter, then you can look for me!
And the rope is here just handy. [<i>Ponders</i>] I'd have got
over it, over any sorrow—I'd have got over that. But this
now—here it is, deep in my heart, and I can't get over it!
[<i>Looks towards the yard</i>] Surely she's not coming back?
[<i>Imitates Anísya</i>] “So nice, so nice. I'd lie down here with
you.” Oh, the baggage! Well then, here I am! Come
and cuddle when they've taken me down from the rafter!
There's only one way! [<i>Takes the rope and pulls it</i>].</p>

<p><i>Mítritch, who is tipsy, sits up and won't let go of the rope.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Shan't give it up! Shan't give it to no
one! I'll bring it myself! I said I'd bring the straw—and
so I will! Nikíta, is that you? [<i>Laughs</i>] Oh, the
devil! Have you come to get the straw?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Give me the rope!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> No, you wait a bit! The peasants sent me!
I'll bring it … [<i>Rises to his feet and begins getting the straw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>together, but reels for a time, then falls</i>] It has beaten me.
It's stronger …</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Give me the rope!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Didn't I say I won't! Oh, Nikíta, you're as
stupid as a hog! [<i>Laughs</i>] I love you, but you're a fool!
You see that I'm drunk … devil take you! You think
I need you?… You just look at me; I'm a Non … fool,
can't say it—Non-commissioned Officer of Her Majesty's
very First Regiment of Grenadier Guards! I've served
Tsar and country, loyal and true! But who am I? You
think I'm a warrior? No, I'm not a warrior; I'm the
very least of men, a poor lost orphan! I swore not to
drink, and now I had a smoke, and … Well then, do you
think I'm afraid of you? No fear; I'm afraid of no man!
I've taken to drink, and I'll drink! Now I'll go it for a
fortnight; I'll go it hard! I'll drink my last shirt; I'll
drink my cap; I'll pawn my passport; and I'm afraid of
no one! They flogged me in the army to stop me drinking!
They switched and switched! “Well,” they say,
“will you leave off?” “No,” says I! Why should I be
afraid of them? Here I am! Such as I am, God made me!
I swore off drinking, and didn't drink. Now I've took to
drink, and I'll drink! And I fear no man! 'Cos I don't
lie; but just as … Why should one mind them—such
muck as they are! “Here you are,” I say; that's me.
A priest told me, the devil's the biggest bragger! “As
soon,” says he, “as you begin to brag, you get frightened;
and as soon as you fear men, then the hoofed one
just collars you and pushes you where he likes!” But
as I don't fear men, I'm easy! I can spit in the devil's
beard, and at the sow his mother! He can't do me no
harm! There, put that in your pipe!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>crossing himself</i>] True enough! What was I
about? [<i>Throws down the rope</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>rises</i>] You tell me not to fear men?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
<span class="speaker">MÍTRITCH.</span> Why fear such muck as they are? You look
at 'em in the bath-house! All made of one paste! One
has a bigger belly, another a smaller; that's all the difference
there is! Fancy being afraid of 'em! Deuce take
'em!</p>

<h3 class="smcap">Scene 2.</h3>

<p class="scene">Interior of hut, full of people, some sitting round tables and
others standing. In the front corner Akoulína and the Bridegroom.
On one of the tables an Icón and a loaf of rye-bread.
Among the visitors are Marína, her husband, and a Police
Officer, also a Hired Driver, the Matchmaker, and the Best
Man. The women are singing. Anísya carries round the drink.
The singing stops.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THE DRIVER.</span> If we are to go, let's go! The church ain't
so near.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THE BEST MAN.</span> All right; you wait a bit till the step-father
has given his blessing. But where is he?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> He is coming—coming at once, dear friends!
Have another glass all of you; don't refuse!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THE MATCHMAKER.</span> Why is he so long? We've been
waiting such a time!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> He's coming; coming directly, coming in no
time! He'll be here before one could plait a girl's hair
who's had her hair cropped! Drink, friends! [<i>Offers the
drink</i>] Coming at once! Sing again, my pets, meanwhile!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THE DRIVER.</span> They've sung all their songs, waiting here!</p>

<p><i>The women sing. Nikíta and Akím enter during the singing.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>holds his father's arm and pushes him in before him</i>]
Go, father; I can't do without you!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> I don't like—I mean what d'ye call it …</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
<span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>to the women</i>] Enough! Be quiet! [<i>Looks round
the hut</i>] Marína, are you there?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THE MATCHMAKER.</span> Go, take the icón, and give them your
blessing!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Wait a while! [<i>Looks round</i>] Akoulína, are you
there?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATCHMAKER.</span> What are you calling everybody for?
Where should she be? How queer he seems!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Gracious goodness! Why, he's barefoot!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Father, you are here! Look at me! Christian
Commune, you are all here, and I am here! I am …
[<i>Falls on his knees</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Nikíta darling, what's the matter with <ins title="you.">you?</ins>
Oh my head, my head!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATCHMAKER.</span> Here's a go!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> I did say he was taking too much of that
French wine! Come to your senses; what are you about?</p>

<p><i>They try to lift him; he takes no heed of them, but looks in
front of him.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Christian Commune! I have sinned, and I wish
to confess!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> [<i>shakes him by the shoulder</i>] Are you mad?
Dear friends, he's gone crazy! He must be taken away!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>shakes her off</i>] Leave me alone! And you,
father, hear me! And first, Marína, look here! [<i>Bows
to the ground to her and rises</i>] I have sinned towards you!
I promised to marry you, I tempted you, and forsook
you! Forgive me, in Christ's name! [<i>Again bows to the
ground before her</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> And what are you drivelling about? It's not
becoming! No one wants to know! Get up! It's like
your impudence!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Oh, oh, he's bewitched! And however did
it happen? It's a spell! Get up! what nonsense are
you jabbering? [<i>Pulls him</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>shakes his head</i>] Don't touch me! Forgive me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>my sin towards you, Marína! Forgive me, for Christ's
sake!</p>

<p><i>Marína covers her face with her hands in silence.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Get up, I tell you! Don't be so impudent!
What are you thinking about—to recall it? Enough
humbug! It's shameful! Oh my poor head! He's
quite crazy!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>pushes his wife away and turns to Akoulína</i>]
Akoulína, now I'll speak to you! Listen, Christian Commune!
I'm a fiend, Akoulína! I have sinned against
you! Your father died no natural death! He was
poisoned!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>screams</i>] Oh my head! What's he about?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> The man's beside himself! Lead him away!</p>

<p><i>The folk come up and try to seize him.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM</span> [<i>motions them back with his arms</i>] Wait! You lads,
what d'ye call it, wait, I mean!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Akoulína, I poisoned him! Forgive me, in
Christ's name!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA</span> [<i>jumps up</i>] He's telling lies! I know who
did it!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATCHMAKER.</span> What are you about? You sit still!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> Oh Lord, what sins, what sins!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">POLICE OFFICER.</span> Seize him, and send for the Elder! We
must draw up an indictment and have witnesses to it!
Get up and come here!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM</span> [<i>to Police Officer</i>] Now you—with the bright buttons—I
mean, you wait! Let him, what d'ye call it,
speak out, I mean!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">POLICE OFFICER.</span> Mind, old man, and don't interfere! I
have to draw up an indictment!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> Eh, what a fellow you are; wait, I say! Don't
talk, I mean, about, what d'ye call it, 'ditements! Here
God's work is being done.… A man is confessing, I
mean! And you, what d'ye call it … 'ditements!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">POLICE OFFICER.</span> The Elder!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
<span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> Let God's work be done, I mean, and then you,
I mean, you do your business!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> And, Akoulína, my sin is great towards you; I
seduced you; forgive me in Christ's name! [<i>Bows to the
ground before her</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA</span> [<i>leaves the table</i>] Let me go! I shan't be
married! He told me to, but I shan't now!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">POLICE OFFICER.</span> Repeat what you have said.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Wait, sir, let me finish!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM</span> [<i>with rapture</i>] Speak, my son! Tell everything—you'll
feel better! Confess to God, don't fear men! God—God!
It is He!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> I poisoned the father, dog that I am, and I
ruined the daughter! She was in my power, and I
ruined her, and her baby!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> True, that's true!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> I smothered the baby in the cellar with a board!
I sat on it and smothered it—and its bones crunched!
[<i>Weeps</i>] And I buried it! I did it, all alone!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> He raves! I told him to!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Don't shield me! I fear no one now! Forgive
me, Christian Commune! [<i>Bows to the ground</i>].</p>

<p><i>Silence.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">POLICE OFFICER.</span> Bind him! The marriage is evidently
off!</p>

<p><i>Men come up with their belts.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Wait, there's plenty of time! [<i>Bows to the ground
before his father</i>] Father, dear father, forgive me too,—fiend
that I am! You told me from the first, when I
took to bad ways, you said then, “If a claw is caught,
the bird is lost!” I would not listen to your words, dog
that I was, and it has turned out as you said! Forgive me,
for Christ's sake!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM</span> [<i>rapturously</i>] God will forgive you, my own son!
[<i>Embraces him</i>] You have had no mercy on yourself, He
will show mercy on you! God—God! It is He!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
<i>Enter Elder.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">ELDER.</span> There are witnesses enough here.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">POLICE OFFICER.</span> We will have the examination at once.</p>

<p><i>Nikíta is bound.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA</span> [<i>goes and stands by his side</i>] I shall tell the
truth! Ask me!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>bound</i>] No need to ask! I did it all myself.
The design was mine, and the deed was mine. Take me
where you like. I will say no more!</p>
