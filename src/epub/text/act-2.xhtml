			<h2>
				<span epub:type="label">Act</span>
				<span epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">II</span>
			</h2>
			<p class="scene">The scene represents the village street. To the left the outside of Peter’s hut, built of logs, with a porch in the middle; to the right of the hut the gates and a corner of the yard buildings. Anísya is beating hemp in the street near the corner of the yard. Six months have elapsed since the <a href="#act1">First Act</a>.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">stops and listens</i> Mumbling something again. He’s probably got off the stove.</p>
			<p>
				<i>Akoulína enters, carrying two pails on a yoke.</i>
			</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> He’s calling. You go and see what he wants, kicking up such a row.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> Why don’t you go?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Go, I tell you! <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Exit Akoulína into hut</i> He’s bothering me to death. Won’t let out where the money is, and that’s all about it. He was out in the passage the other day. He must have been hiding it there. Now, I don’t know myself where it is. Thank goodness he’s afraid of parting with it, so that at least it will stay in the house. If only I could manage to find it. He hadn’t it on him yesterday. Now I don’t know where it can be. He has quite worn the life out of me.</p>
			<p>
				<i>Enter Akoulína, tying her kerchief over her head.</i>
			</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Where are you off to?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> Where? Why, he’s told me to go for Aunt Martha. “Fetch my sister,” he says. “I am going to die,” he says. “I have a word to say to her.”</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">aside</i> Asking for his sister? Oh my poor head! Sure he wants to give it her. What shall I do? Oh! <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">To Akoulína</i> Don’t go! Where are you off to?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> To call Aunt.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Don’t go I tell you, I’ll go myself. You go and take the clothes to the river to rinse. Else you’ll not have finished by the evening.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> But he told me to go.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> You go and do as you’re bid. I tell you I’ll fetch Martha myself. Take the shirts off the fence.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> The shirts? But maybe you’ll not go. He’s given the order.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Didn’t I say I’d go? Where’s Nan?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> Nan? Minding the calves.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Send her here. I dare say they’ll not run away. <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Akoulína collects the clothes, and exit</i>.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> If one doesn’t go he’ll scold. If one goes he’ll give the money to his sister. All my trouble will be wasted. I don’t myself know what I’m to do. My poor head’s splitting. <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Continues to work</i>.</p>
			<p>
				<i>Enter Matryóna, with a stick and a bundle, in outdoor clothes.</i>
			</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> May the Lord help you, honey.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">looks round, stops working, and claps her hands with joy</i> Well, I never expected this! Mother Matryóna, God has sent the right guest at the right time.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Well, how are things?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Ah, I’m driven well-nigh crazy. It’s awful!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Well, still alive, I hear?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Oh, don’t talk about it. He doesn’t live and doesn’t die!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> But the money⁠—has he given it to anybody?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> He’s just sending for his sister Martha⁠—probably about the money.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Well, naturally! But hasn’t he given it to any one else?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> To no one. I watch like a hawk.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> And where is it?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> He doesn’t let out. And I can’t find out in any way. He hides it now here, now there, and I can’t do anything because of Akoulína. Idiot though she is, she keeps watch, and is always about. Oh my poor head! I’m bothered to death.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Oh, my jewel, if he gives the money to any one but you, you’ll never cease regretting it as long as you live! They’ll turn you out of house and home without anything. You’ve been worriting, and worriting all your life with one you don’t love, and will have to go a-begging when you are a widow.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> No need to tell me, mother. My heart’s that weary, and I don’t know what to do. No one to get a bit of advice from. I told Nikíta, but he’s frightened of the job. The only thing he did was to tell me yesterday it was hidden under the floor.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Well, and did you look there?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> I couldn’t. The old man himself was in the room. I notice that sometimes he carries it about on him, and sometimes he hides it.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> But you, my lass, must remember that if once he gives you the slip there’s no getting it right again! <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Whispering</i> Well, and did you give him the strong tea?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Oh! oh!⁠ ⁠… <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">About to answer, but sees neighbour and stops</i>.</p>
			<p>
				<i>The neighbour (a woman) passes the hut, and listens to a call from within.</i>
			</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR</span> <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">to Anísya</i> I say, Anísya! Eh, Anísya! There’s your old man calling, I think.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> That’s the way he always coughs⁠—just as if he were screaming. He’s getting very bad.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR</span> <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">approaches Matryóna</i> How do you do, granny? Have you come far?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Straight from home, dear. Come to see my son. Brought him some shirts⁠—can’t help thinking of these things, you see, when it’s one’s own child.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> Yes, that’s always so. <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">To Anísya</i> And I was thinking of beginning to bleach the linen, but it is a bit early, no one has begun yet.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Where’s the hurry?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Well, and has he had communion?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Oh dear yes, the priest was here yesterday.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> I had a look at him yesterday. Dearie me! one wonders his body and soul keep together. And, O Lord, the other day he seemed just at his last gasp, so that they laid him under the holy icóns.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1" id="noteref-1" epub:type="noteref">1</a> They started lamenting and got ready to lay him out.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> He came to, and creeps about again.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Well, and is he to have extreme unction?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> The neighbours advise it. If he lives till to-morrow we’ll send for the priest.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> Oh, Anísya dear, I should think your heart must be heavy. As the saying goes, “Not he is sick that’s ill in bed, but he that sits and waits in dread.”</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Yes, if it were only over one way or other!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> Yes, that’s true, dying for a year, it’s no joke. You’re bound hand and foot like that.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Ah, but a widow’s lot is also bitter. It’s all right as long as one’s young, but who’ll care for you when you’re old? Oh yes, old age is not pleasure. Just look at me. I’ve not walked very far, and yet am so footsore I don’t know how to stand. Where’s my son?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Ploughing. But you come in and we’ll get the samovár ready; the tea’ll set you up again.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">sitting down</i> Yes, it’s true, I’m quite done up, my dears. As to extreme unction, that’s absolutely necessary. Besides, they say it’s good for the soul.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Yes, we’ll send to-morrow.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Yes, you had better. And we’ve had a wedding down in our parts.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> What, in spring?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2" id="noteref-2" epub:type="noteref">2</a></p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Ah, now if it were a poor man, then, as the saying is, it’s always unseasonable for a poor man to marry. But it’s Simon Matvéyitch, he’s married that Marína.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> What luck for her!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> He’s a widower. I suppose there are children?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Four of ’em. What decent girl would have him! Well, so he’s taken her, and she’s glad. You see, the vessel was not sound, so the wine trickled out.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> Oh my! And what do people say to it? And he, a rich peasant!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> They are living well enough so far.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> Yes, it’s true enough. Who wants to marry where there are children? There now, there’s our Michael. He’s such a fellow, dear me⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT’S VOICE.</span> Hullo, Mávra. Where the devil are you? Go and drive the cow in.</p>
			<p>
				<i>Exit Neighbour.</i>
			</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">while the Neighbour is within hearing speaks in her ordinary voice</i> Yes, lass, thank goodness, she’s married. At any rate my old fool won’t go bothering about Nikíta. Now <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">suddenly changing her tone</i>, she’s gone! <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Whispers</i> I say, did you give him the tea?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Don’t speak about it. He’d better die of himself. It’s no use⁠—he doesn’t die, and I have only taken a sin on my soul. O-oh, my head, my head! Oh, why did you give me those powders?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> What of the powders? The sleeping powders, lass⁠—why not give them? No evil can come of them.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> I am not talking of the sleeping ones, but the others, the white ones.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Well, honey, those powders are medicinal.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">sighs</i> I know, yet it’s frightening. Though he’s worried me to death.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Well, and did you use many?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> I gave two doses.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Was anything noticeable?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> I had a taste of the tea myself⁠—just a little bitter. And he drank them with the tea and says, “Even tea disgusts me,” and I say, “Everything tastes bitter when one’s sick.” But I felt that scared, mother.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Don’t go thinking about it. The more one thinks the worse it is.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> I wish you’d never given them to me and led me into sin. When I think of it something seems to tear my heart. Oh dear, why did you give them to me?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> What do you mean, honey? Lord help you! Why are you turning it on to me? Mind, lass, don’t go twisting matters from the sick on to the healthy. If anything were to happen, I stand aside! I know nothing! I’m aware of nothing! I’ll kiss the cross on it; I never gave you any kind of powders, never saw any, never heard of any, and never knew there were such powders. You think about yourself, lass. Why, we were talking about you the other day. “Poor thing, what torture she endures. The step-daughter an idiot; the old man rotten, sucking her life-blood. What wouldn’t one be ready to do in such a case!”</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> I’m not going to deny it. A life such as mine could make one do worse than that. It could make you hang yourself or throttle him. Is this a life?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> That’s just it. There’s no time to stand gaping; the money must be found one way or other, and then he must have his tea.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> O-oh, my head, my head! I can’t think what to do. I am so frightened; he’d better die of himself. I don’t want to have it on my soul.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">viciously</i> And why doesn’t he show the money? Does he mean to take it along with him? Is no one to have it? Is that right? God forbid such a sum should be lost all for nothing. Isn’t that a sin? What’s he doing? Is he worth considering?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> I don’t know anything. He’s worried me to death.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> What is it you don’t know? The business is clear. If you make a slip now, you’ll repent it all your life. He’ll give the money to his sister and you’ll be left without.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> O-oh dear! Yes, and he did send for her⁠—I must go.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> You wait a bit and light the samovár first. We’ll give him some tea and search him together⁠—we’ll find it, no fear.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Oh dear, oh dear; supposing something were to happen.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> What now? What’s the good of waiting? Do you want the money to slip from your hand when it’s just in sight? You go and do as I say.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Well, I’ll go and light the samovár.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Go, honey, do the business so as not to regret it afterwards. That’s right! <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Anísya turns to go. Matryóna calls her back</i>.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Just a word. Don’t tell Nikíta about the business. He’s silly. God forbid he should find out about the powders. The Lord only knows what he would do. He’s so tender-hearted. D’you know, he usen’t to be able to kill a chicken. Don’t tell him. ’Twould be a fine go, he wouldn’t understand things. <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Stops horror-struck as Peter appears in the doorway</i>.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">PETER</span> <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">holding on to the wall, creeps out into the porch and calls with a faint voice</i> How’s it one can’t make you hear? Oh, oh, Anísya! Who’s there? <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Drops on the bench</i>.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">steps from behind the corner</i> Why have you come out? You should have stayed where you were lying.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Has the girl gone for Martha? It’s very hard.⁠ ⁠… Oh, if only death would come quicker!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> She had no time. I sent her to the river. Wait a bit, I’ll go myself when I’m ready.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Send Nan. Where’s she? Oh, I’m that bad! Oh, death’s at hand!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> I’ve sent for her already.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Oh dear! Then where is she?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Where’s she got to, the plague seize her!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Oh, dear! I can’t bear it. All my inside’s on fire. It’s as if a gimlet were boring me. Why have you left me as if I were a dog?⁠ ⁠… no one to give me a drink.⁠ ⁠… Oh⁠ ⁠… send Nan to me.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Here she is. Nan, go to father.</p>
			<p>
				<i>Nan runs in. Anísya goes behind the corner of the house.</i>
			</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Go you. Oh⁠ ⁠… to Aunt Martha, tell her father wants her; say she’s to come, I want her.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> All right.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Wait a bit. Tell her she’s to come quick. Tell her I’m dying. O-oh!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> I’ll just get my shawl and be off. <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Runs off</i>.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">winking</i> Now then, mind and look sharp, lass. Go into the hut, hunt about everywhere, like a dog that’s hunting for fleas: look under everything, and I’ll search him.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">to Matryóna</i> I feel a bit bolder, somehow, now you’re here. <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Goes up to porch. To Peter</i> Hadn’t I better light the samovár? Here’s Mother Matryóna come to see her son; you’ll have a cup of tea with her?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Well then, light it. <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Anísya goes into the house. Matryóna comes up to the porch</i>.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> How do you do?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">bowing</i> How d’you do, my benefactor; how d’you do, my precious⁠ ⁠… still ill, I see. And my old man, he’s that sorry! “Go,” says he, “see how he’s getting on.” He sends his respects to you. <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Bows again</i>.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> I’m dying.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Ah yes, Peter Ignátitch, now I look at you I see, as the saying has it, “Sickness lives where men live.” You’ve shrivelled, shrivelled, all to nothing, poor dear, now I come to look at you. Seems illness does not add to good looks.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> My last hour has come.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Oh well, Peter Ignátitch, it’s God’s will you know, you’ve had communion, and you’ll have unction, God willing. Your missus is a wise woman, the Lord be thanked; she’ll give you a good burial, and have prayers said for your soul, all most respectable! And my son, he’ll look after things meanwhile.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> There’ll be no one to manage things! She’s not steady. Has her head full of folly⁠—why, I know all about it, I know. And my girl is silly and young. I’ve got the homestead together, and there’s no one to attend to things. One can’t help feeling it. <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Whimpers</i>.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Why, if it’s money, or something, you can leave orders.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">PETER</span> <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">to Anísya inside the house</i> Has Nan gone?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">aside</i> There now, he’s remembered!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">from inside</i> She went then and there. Come inside, won’t you? I’ll help you in.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Let me sit here a bit for the last time. The air’s so stuffy inside. Oh, how bad I feel! Oh, my heart’s burning.⁠ ⁠… Oh, if death would only come.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> If God don’t take a soul, the soul can’t go out. Death and life are in God’s will, Peter Ignátitch. You can’t be sure of death either. Maybe you’ll recover yet. There was a man in our village just like that, at the very point of death⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> No, I feel I shall die to-day, I feel it. <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Leans back and shuts his eyes</i>.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">enters</i> Well now, are you coming in or not? You do keep one waiting. Peter! eh, Peter!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">steps aside and beckons to Anísya with her finger</i> Well?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">comes down the porch steps</i> Not there.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> But have you searched everywhere? Under the floor?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> No, it’s not there either. In the shed perhaps; he was rummaging there yesterday.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Go, search, search for all you’re worth. Go all over everywhere, as if you licked with your tongue! But I see he’ll die this very day, his nails are turning blue and his face looks earthy. Is the samovár ready?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Just on the boil.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">comes from the other side, if possible on horseback, up to the gate, and does not see Peter. To Matryóna</i> How d’you do, mother, is all well at home?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> The Lord be thanked, we’re all alive and have a crust to bite.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Well, and how’s master?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Hush, there he sits. <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Points to porch</i>.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Well, let him sit. What’s it to me?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">PETER</span> <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">opens his eyes</i> Nikíta, I say, Nikíta, come here! <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Nikíta approaches. Anísya and Matryóna whisper together</i>.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Why have you come back so early?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> I’ve finished ploughing.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Have you done the strip beyond the bridge?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> It’s too far to go there.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Too far? From here it’s still farther. You’ll have to go on purpose now. You might have made one job of it. <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Anísya, without showing herself, stands and listens</i>.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">approaches</i> Oh, sonnie, why don’t you take more pains for your master? Your master is ill and depends on you; you should serve him as you would your own father, straining every muscle just as I always tell you to.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Well then⁠—o-oh!⁠ ⁠… Get out the seed potatoes, and the women will go and sort them.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">aside</i> No fear, I’m not going. He’s again sending every one away; he must have the money on him now, and wants to hide it somewhere.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Else⁠ ⁠… o-oh! when the time comes for planting, they’ll all be rotten. Oh, I can’t stand it! <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Rises</i>.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">runs up into the porch and holds Peter up</i> Shall I help you into the hut?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Help me in. <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Stops</i> Nikíta!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">angrily</i> What now?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> I shan’t see you again⁠ ⁠… I’ll die to-day.⁠ ⁠… Forgive me,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3" id="noteref-3" epub:type="noteref">3</a> for Christ’s sake, forgive me if I have ever sinned against you⁠ ⁠… If I have sinned in word or deed⁠ ⁠… There’s been all sorts of things. Forgive me!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> What’s there to forgive? I’m a sinner myself.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Ah, sonnie, have some feeling.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Forgive me, for Christ’s sake. <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Weeps</i>.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">snivels</i> God will forgive you, Daddy Peter. I have no cause to complain of you. You’ve never done me any wrong. You forgive me; maybe I’ve sinned worse against you. <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Weeps</i>.</p>
			<p>
				<i>Peter goes in whimpering, Matryóna supporting him.</i>
			</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Oh, my poor head! It’s not without some reason he’s hit on that. <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Approaches Nikíta</i> Why did you say the money was under the floor? It’s not there.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">does not answer, but cries</i> I have never had anything bad from him, nothing but good, and what have I gone and done!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Enough now! Where’s the money?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">angrily</i> How should I know? Go and look for it yourself!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> What’s made you so tender?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> I am sorry for him⁠—that sorry. How he cried! Oh dear!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Look at him⁠—seized with pity! He has found someone to pity too! He’s been treating you like a dog, and even just now was giving orders to have you turned out of the house. You’d better show me some pity!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> What are you to be pitied for?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> If he dies, and the money’s been hidden away⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> No fear, he’ll not hide it⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Oh, Nikíta darling! he’s sent for his sister, and wants to give it to her. It will be a bad lookout for us. How are we going to live, if he gives her the money? They’ll turn me out of the house! You try and manage somehow! You said he went to the shed last night.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> I saw him coming from there, but where he’s shoved it to, who can tell?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Oh, my poor head! I’ll go and have a look there. <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Nikíta steps aside</i>.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">comes out of the hut and down the steps of the porch to Anísya and Nikíta</i> Don’t go anywhere. He’s got the money on him. I felt it on a string round his neck.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Oh my head, my head!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> If you don’t keep wide awake now, then you may whistle for it. If his sister comes⁠—then good-bye to it!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> That’s true. She’ll come and he’ll give it her. What’s to be done? Oh my poor head!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> What is to be done? Why, look here; the samovár is boiling, go and make the tea and pour him out a cup, and then <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">whispers</i> put in all that’s left in the paper. When he’s drunk the cup, then just take it. He’ll not tell, no fear.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Oh! I’m afeared!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Don’t be talking now, but look alive, and I’ll keep his sister off if need be. Mind, don’t make a blunder! Get hold of the money and bring it here, and Nikíta will hide it.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Oh my head, my head! I don’t know how I’m going to⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Don’t talk about it I tell you, do as I bid you. Nikíta!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> What is it?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> You stay here⁠—sit down⁠—in case something is wanted.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">waves his hand</i> Oh these women, what won’t they be up to? Muddle one up completely. Bother them! I’ll really go and fetch out the potatoes.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">catches him by the arm</i> Stay here, I tell you.</p>
			<p>
				<i>Nan enters.</i>
			</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Well?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> She was down in her daughter’s vegetable plot⁠—she’s coming.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Coming! What shall we do?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> There’s plenty of time if you do as I tell you.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> I don’t know what to do; I know nothing, my brain’s all in a whirl. Nan! Go, daughter, and see to the calves, they’ll have run away, I’m afraid.⁠ ⁠… Oh dear, I haven’t the courage.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Go on! I should think the samovár’s boiling over.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Oh my head, my poor head! <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Exit</i>.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">approaches Nikíta</i> Now then, sonnie. <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Sits down beside him</i> Your affairs must also be thought about, and not left anyhow.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> What affairs?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Why, this affair⁠—how you’re to live your life.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> How to live my life? Others live, and I shall live!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> The old man will probably die to-day.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Well, if he dies, God give him rest! What’s that to me?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">keeps looking towards the porch while she speaks</i> Eh, sonnie! Those that are alive have to think about living. One needs plenty of sense in these matters, honey. What do you think? I’ve tramped all over the place after your affairs, I’ve got quite footsore bothering about matters. And you must not forget me when the time comes.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> And what’s it you’ve been bothering about?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> About your affairs, about your future. If you don’t take trouble in good time you’ll get nothing. You know Iván Moséitch? Well, I’ve been to him too. I went there the other day. I had something else to settle, you know. Well, so I sat and chatted awhile and then came to the point. “Tell me, Iván Moséitch,” says I, “how’s one to manage an affair of this kind? Supposing,” says I, “a peasant as is a widower married a second wife, and supposing all the children he has is a daughter by the first wife, and a daughter by the second. Then,” says I, “when that peasant dies, could an outsider get hold of the homestead by marrying the widow? Could he,” says I, “give both the daughters in marriage and remain master of the house himself?” “Yes, he could,” says he, “but,” says he, “it would mean a deal of trouble; still the thing could be managed by means of money, but if there’s no money it’s no good trying.”</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">laughs</i> That goes without saying, only fork out the money. Who does not want money?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Well then, honey, so I spoke out plainly about the affair. And he says, “First and foremost, your son will have to get himself on the register of that village⁠—that will cost something. The elders will have to be treated. And they, you see, they’ll sign. Everything,” says he, “must be done sensibly.” Look, <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">unwraps her kerchief and takes out a paper</i> he’s written out this paper; just read it, you’re a scholar, you know. <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Nikíta reads</i>.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> This paper’s only a decision for the elders to sign. There’s no great wisdom needed for that.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> But you just hear what Iván Moséitch bids us do. “Above all,” he says, “mind and don’t let the money slip away, dame. If she don’t get hold of the money,” he says, “they’ll not let her do it. Money’s the great thing!” So look out, sonnie, things are coming to a head.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> What’s that to me? The money’s hers⁠—so let her look out.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Ah, sonnie, how you look at it! How can a woman manage such affairs? Even if she does get the money, is she capable of arranging it all? One knows what a woman is! You’re a man anyhow. You can hide it, and all that. You see, you’ve after all got more sense, in case of anything happening.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Oh, your woman’s notions are all so inexpedient!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Why inexpedient? You just collar the money, and the woman’s in your hands. And then should she ever turn snappish you’d be able to tighten the reins!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Bother you all⁠—I’m going.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">quite pale, runs out of the hut and round the corner to Matryóna</i> So it was, it was on him! Here it is! <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Shows that she has something under her apron</i>.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Give it to Nikíta, he’ll hide it. Nikíta, take it and hide it somewhere.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> All right, give here!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> O-oh, my poor head! No, I’d better do it myself. <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Goes towards the gate</i>.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">seizing her by the arm</i> Where are you going to? You’ll be missed. There’s the sister coming; give it him; he knows what to do. Eh, you blockhead!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">stops irresolutely</i> Oh, my head, my head!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Well, give it here. I’ll shove it away somewhere.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Where will you shove it to?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">laughing</i> Why, are you afraid?</p>
			<p>
				<i>Enter Akoulína, carrying clothes from the wash.</i>
			</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> O-oh, my poor head! <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Gives the money</i> Mind, Nikíta.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> What are you afraid of? I’ll hide it so that I’ll not be able to find it myself. <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Exit</i>.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">stands in terror</i> Oh dear, and supposing he⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Well, is he dead?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Yes, he seems dead. He did not move when I took it.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Go in, there’s Akoulína.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Well there, I’ve done the sin and he has the money.⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Have done and go in! There’s Martha coming!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> There now, I’ve trusted him. What’s going to happen now? <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Exit</i>.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MARTHA</span> <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">enters from one side, Akoulína enters from the other. To Akoulína</i> I should have come before, but I was at my daughter’s. Well, how’s the old man? Is he dying?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA</span> <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">puts down the clothes</i> Don’t know, I’ve been to the river.</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MARTHA</span> <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">pointing to Matryóna</i> Who’s that?</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> I’m from Zoúevo. I’m Nikíta’s mother from Zoúevo, my dearie. Good afternoon to you. He’s withering, withering away, poor dear⁠—your brother, I mean. He came out himself. “Send for my sister,” he said, “because,” said he⁠ ⁠… Dear me, why, I do believe, he’s dead!</p>
			<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">runs out screaming. Clings to a post, and begins wailing</i><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4" id="noteref-4" epub:type="noteref">4</a> Oh, oh, ah! who-o-o-m have you left me to, why-y-y have you dese-e-e-e-rted me⁠—a miserable widow⁠ ⁠… to live my life alone⁠ ⁠… Why have you closed your bright eyes⁠ ⁠…</p>
