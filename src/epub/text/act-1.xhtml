<h2><a name="act1" id="act1">ACT I</a></h2>

<p class="scene">The Act takes place in autumn in a large village. The
Scene represents Peter's roomy hut. Peter is sitting on a wooden
bench, mending a horse-collar. Anísya and Akoulína are
spinning, and singing a part-song.</p>


<p><span class="speaker">PETER</span> [<i>looking out of the window</i>] The horses have
got loose again. If we don't look out they'll be killing
the colt. Nikíta! Hey, Nikíta! Is the fellow deaf?
[<i>Listens. To the women</i>] Shut up, one can't hear anything.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>from outside</i>] What?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Drive the horses in.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span>. We'll drive 'em in. All in good time.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER</span> [<i>shaking his head</i>] Ah, these labourers! If I
were well, I'd not keep one on no account. There's
nothing but bother with 'em. [<i>Rises and sits down again</i>]
Nikíta!… It's no good shouting. One of you'd better
go. Go, Akoúl, drive 'em in.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> What? The horses?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> What else?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> All right. [<i>Exit</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Ah, but he's a loafer, that lad … no good at
all. Won't stir a finger if he can help it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> You're so mighty brisk yourself. When you're
not sprawling on the top of the oven you're squatting on
the bench. To goad others to work is all you're fit for.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> If one weren't to goad you on a bit, one'd
have no roof left over one's head before the year's out.
Oh what people!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> You go shoving a dozen jobs on to one's
shoulders, and then do nothing but scold. It's easy to
lie on the oven and give orders.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER</span> [<i>sighing</i>] Oh, if 'twere not for this sickness that's
got hold of me, I'd not keep him on another day.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA</span> [<i>off the scene</i>] Gee up, gee, woo. [<i>A colt
neighs, the stamping of horses' feet and the creaking of the gate
are heard</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Bragging, that's what he's good at. I'd like to
sack him, I would indeed.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>mimicking him</i>] “Like to sack him.” You buckle
to yourself, and then talk.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA</span> [<i>enters</i>] It's all I could do to drive 'em in.
That piebald always will …</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> And where's Nikíta?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> Where's Nikíta? Why, standing out there
in the street.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> What's he standing there for?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> What's he standing there for? He stands
there jabbering.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> One can't get any sense out of her! Who's he
jabbering with?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA</span> [<i>does not hear</i>] Eh, what?</p>

<p><i>Peter waves her off. She sits down to her spinning.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN</span> [<i>running in to her mother</i>] Nikíta's father and
mother have come. They're going to take him away.
It's true!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Nonsense!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Yes. Blest if they're not! [<i>Laughing</i>] I was
just going by, and Nikíta, he says, “Good-bye, Anna
Petróvna,” he says, “you must come and dance at my
wedding. I'm leaving you,” he says, and laughs.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>to her husband</i>] There now. Much he cares. You
see, he wants to leave of himself. “Sack him” indeed!</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Well, let him go. Just as if I couldn't find
somebody else.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> And what about the money he's had in advance?</p>

<p><i>Nan stands listening at the door for awhile, and then exit.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER</span> [<i>frowning</i>] The money? Well, he can work it
off in summer, anyhow.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Well, of course you'll be glad if he goes and
you've not got to feed him. It's only me as'll have to
work like a horse all the winter. That lass of yours
isn't over fond of work either. And you'll be lying up on
the oven. I know you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> What's the good of wearing out one's tongue
before one has the hang of the matter?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> The yard's full of cattle. You've not sold the
cow, and have kept all the sheep for the winter: feeding
and watering 'em alone takes all one's time, and you
want to sack the labourer. But I tell you straight, I'm not
going to do a man's work! I'll go and lie on the top of
the oven same as you, and let everything go to pot!
You may do what you like.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER</span> [<i>to Akoulína</i>] Go and see about the feeding,
will you? it's time.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> The feeding? All right. [<i>Puts on a coat
and takes a rope</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> I'm not going to work for you. You go and
work yourself. I've had enough of it, so there!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> That'll do. What are you raving about? Like
a sheep with the staggers!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> You're a crazy cur, you are! One gets neither
work nor pleasure from you. Eating your fill, that's all
you do, you palsied cur, you!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER</span> [<i>spits and puts on coat</i>] Faugh! The Lord have
mercy! I'd better go myself and see what's up. [<i>Exit</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>after him</i>] Scurvy long-nosed devil!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> What are you swearing at dad for?</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Hold your noise, you idiot!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA</span> [<i>going to the door</i>] I know why you're swearing
at him. You're an idiot yourself, you bitch. I'm not
afraid of you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> What do you mean? [<i>Jumps up and looks round
for something to hit her with</i>] Mind, or I'll give you one
with the poker.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA</span> [<i>opening the door</i>] Bitch! devil! that's what
you are! Devil! bitch! bitch! devil! [<i>Runs off</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA</span> [<i>ponders</i>] “Come and dance at my wedding!”
What new plan is this? Marry? Mind, Nikíta, if that's
your intention, I'll go and … No, I can't live without
him. I won't let him go.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>enters, looks round, and seeing Anísya alone
approaches quickly. In a low tone</i>] Here's a go; I'm in a
regular fix! That governor of mine wants to take me
away,—tells me I'm to come home. Says quite straight
I'm to marry and live at home.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Well, go and marry! What's that to me?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Is that it? Why, here am I reckoning how
best to consider matters, and just hear her! She tells
me to go and marry. Why's that? [<i>Winking</i>] Has she
forgotten?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Yes, go and marry! What do I care?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> What are you spitting for? Just see, she won't
even let me stroke her.… What's the matter?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> This! That you want to play me false.… If
you do,—why, I don't want you either. So now you know!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> That'll do, Anísya. Do you think I'll forget
you? Never while I live! I'll not play you false, that's
flat. I've been thinking that supposing they do go and
make me marry, I'd still come back to you. If only he
don't make me live at home.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Much need I'll have of you, once you're married.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> There's a go now. How is it possible to go
against one's father's will?</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Yes, I daresay, shove it all on your father.
You know it's your own doing. You've long been plotting
with that slut of yours, Marína. It's she has put you up
to it. She didn't come here for nothing t'other day.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Marína? What's she to me? Much I care
about her!… Plenty of them buzzing around.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Then what has made your father come here?
It's you have told him to. You've gone and deceived me.
[<i>Cries</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Anísya, do you believe in a God or not? I
never so much as dreamt of it. I know nothing at all
about it. I never even dreamt of it—that's flat! My old
dad has got it all out of his own pate.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> If you don't wish it yourself who can force you?
He can't drive you like an ass.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Well, I reckon it's not possible to go against
one's parent. But it's not by my wish.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Don't you budge, that's all about it!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> There was a fellow wouldn't budge, and the
village elder gave him such a hiding.… That's what
it might come to! I've no great wish for that sort of
thing. They say it touches one up.…</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Shut up with your nonsense. Nikíta, listen to
me: if you marry that Marína I don't know what I won't
do to myself.… I shall lay hands on myself! I have
sinned, I have gone against the law, but I can't go back
now. If you go away I'll …</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Why should I go? Had I wanted to go—I
should have gone long ago. There was Iván Semyónitch
t'other day—offered me a place as his coachman.…
Only fancy what a life that would have been!
But I did not go. Because, I reckon, I am good enough
for any one. Now if you did not love me it would be a
different matter.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Yes, and that's what you should remember.
My old man will die one of these fine days, I'm thinking;
then we could cover our sin, make it all right and lawful,
and then you'll be master here.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Where's the good of making plans? What do
I care? I work as hard as if I were doing it for myself.
My master loves me, and his missus loves me. And if
the wenches run after me, it's not my fault, that's flat.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> And you'll love me?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>embracing her</i>] There, as you have ever been
in my heart …</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> [<i>enters, and crosses herself a long time before the
icón. Nikíta and Anísya step apart</i>] What I saw I didn't
perceive, what I heard I didn't hearken to. Playing with
the lass, eh? Well,—even a calf will play. Why shouldn't
one have some fun when one's young? But your master
is out in the yard a-calling you, sonnie.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> I only came to get the axe.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> I know, sonnie, I know; them sort of axes
are mostly to be found where the women are.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>stooping to pick up axe</i>] I say, mother, is it true
you want me to marry? As I reckon, that's quite unnecessary.
Besides, I've got no wish that way.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Eh, honey! why should you marry? Go on
as you are. It's all the old man. You'd better go, sonnie,
we can talk these matters over without you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> It's a queer go! One moment I'm to be married,
the next, not. I can't make head or tail of it. [<i>Exit</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> What's it all about then? Do you really wish
him to get married?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Eh, why should he marry, my jewel? It's
all nonsense, all my old man's drivel. “Marry, marry.”
But he's reckoning without his host. You know the
saying, “From oats and hay, why should horses stray?”
When you've enough and to spare, why look elsewhere?
And so in this case. [<i>Winks</i>] Don't I see which way the
wind blows?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Where's the good of my pretending to you,
Mother Matryóna? You know all about it. I have
sinned. I love your son.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Dear me, here's news! D'you think Mother
Matryóna didn't know? Eh, lassie,—Mother Matryóna's
been ground, and ground again, ground fine! This much
I can tell you, my jewel: Mother Matryóna can see
through a brick wall three feet thick. I know it all, my
jewel! I know what young wives need sleeping draughts
for, so I've brought some along. [<i>Unties a knot in her
handkerchief and brings out paper-packets</i>] As much as is
wanted, I see, and what's not wanted I neither see nor
perceive! There! Mother Matryóna has also been young.
I had to know a thing or two to live with my old fool. I
know seventy-and-seven dodges. But I see your old
man's quite seedy, quite seedy! How's one to live with
such as him? Why, if you pricked him with a hay-fork
it wouldn't fetch blood. See if you don't bury him before
the spring. Then you'll need some one in the house.
Well, what's wrong with my son? He'll do as well as
another. Then where's the advantage of my taking him
away from a good place? Am I my child's enemy?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Oh, if only he does not go away.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> He won't go away, birdie. It's all nonsense.
You know my old man. His wits are always
wool-gathering; yet sometimes he takes a thing into his
pate, and it's as if it were wedged in, you can't knock
it out with a hammer.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> And what started this business?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Well, you see, my jewel, you yourself know
what a fellow with women the lad is,—and he's handsome
too, though I say it as shouldn't. Well, you know, he
was living at the railway, and they had an orphan wench
there to cook for them. Well, that same wench took to
running after him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Marína?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Yes, the plague seize her! Whether anything
happened or not, anyhow something got to my old
man's ears. Maybe he heard from the neighbours, maybe
she's been and blabbed …</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Well, she is a bold hussy!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> So my old man—the old blockhead—off he
goes: “Marry, marry,” he says, “he must marry her and
cover the sin,” he says. “We must take the lad home,”
he says, “and he shall marry,” he says. Well, I did my
best to make him change his mind, but, dear me, no.
So, all right, thinks I,—I'll try another dodge. One always
has to entice them fools in this way, just pretend to be
of their mind, and when it comes to the point one goes
and turns it all one's own way. You know, a woman has
time to think seventy-and-seven thoughts while falling
off the oven, so how's such as he to see through it?
“Well, yes,” says I, “it would be a good job,—only we
must consider well beforehand. Why not go and see our
son, and talk it over with Peter Ignátitch and hear what
he has to say?” So here we are.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Oh dear, oh dear, how will it all end? Supposing
his father just orders him to marry her?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Orders, indeed. Chuck his orders to the
dogs! Don't you worry; that affair will never come off.
I'll go to your old man myself, and sift and strain this
matter clear—there will be none of it left. I have come
here only for the look of the thing. A very likely thing!
Here's my son living in happiness and expecting happiness,
and I'll go and match him with a slut! No fear,
I'm not a fool!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> And she—this Marína—came dangling after him
here! Mother, would you believe, when they said he was
going to marry, it was as if a knife had gone right through
my heart. I thought he cared for her.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Oh, my jewel! Why, you don't think him
such a fool, that he should go and care for a homeless baggage
like that? Nikíta is a sensible fellow, you see. He
knows whom to love. So don't you go and fret, my
jewel. We'll not take him away, and we won't marry
him. No, we'll let him stay on, if you'll only oblige us
with a little money.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> All I know is, that I could not live if Nikíta
went away.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Naturally, when one's young it's no easy
matter! You, a wench in full bloom, to be living with the
dregs of a man like that husband of yours.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Mother Matryóna, would you believe it? I'm
that sick of him, that sick of this long-nosed cur of mine,
I can hardly bear to look at him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Yes, I see, it's one of them cases. Just
look here, [<i>looks round and whispers</i>] I've been to see that
old man, you know—he's given me simples of two kinds.
This, you see, is a sleeping draught. “Just give him one
of these powders,” he says, “and he'll sleep so sound you
might jump on him!” And this here, “This is that kind
of simple,” he says, “that if you give one some of it to
drink it has no smell whatever, but its strength is very
great. There are seven doses here, a pinch at a time.
Give him seven pinches,” he says, “and she won't have
far to look for freedom,” he says.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> O-o-oh! What's that?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> “No sign whatever,” he says. He's taken
a rouble for it. “Can't sell it for less,” he says. Because
it's no easy matter to get 'em, you know. I
paid him, dearie, out of my own money. If she takes
them, thinks I, it's all right; if she don't, I can let old
Michael's daughter have them.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> O-o-oh! But mayn't some evil come of them?
I'm frightened!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> What evil, my jewel? If your old man was
hale and hearty, 'twould be a different matter, but he's
neither alive nor dead as it is. He's not for this world.
Such things often happen.</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> O-o-oh, my poor head! I'm afeared, Mother
Matryóna, lest some evil come of them. No. That
won't do.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Just as you like. I might even return
them to him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> And are they to be used in the same way as
the others? Mixed in water?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Better in tea, he says. “You can't notice
anything,” he says, “no smell nor nothing.” He's a cute
old fellow too.</p>

Matryóna gives Anísya the powders.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> [<i>taking the powder</i>] O-oh, my poor head! Could
I have ever thought of such a thing if my life were not a
very hell?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> You'll not forget that rouble? I promised
to take it to the old man. He's had some trouble, too.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Of course? [<i>Goes to her box and hides the
powders</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> And now, my jewel, keep it as close as you
can, so that no one should find it out. Heaven defend
that it should happen, but <em>if</em> any one notices it, tell 'em
it's for the black-beetles. [<i>Takes the rouble</i>] It's also
used for beetles. [<i>Stops short</i>].</p>

<p><i>Enter Akím, who crosses himself in front of the icón, and
then Peter, who sits down.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Well then, how's it to be, Daddy Akím?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> As it's best, Peter Ignátitch, as it's best …
I mean—as it's best. 'Cos why? I'm afeared of what
d'you call 'ems, some tomfoolery, you know. I'd like
to, what d'you call it … to start, you know, start
the lad honest, I mean. But supposing you'd rather,
what d'you call it, we might, I mean, what's name? As
it's best …</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> All right. All right. Sit down and let's talk it
over. [<i>Akím sits down</i>] Well then, what's it all about?
You want him to marry?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> As to marrying, he might bide a while,
Peter Ignátitch. You know our poverty, Peter Ignátitch.
What's he to marry on? We've hardly enough to eat
ourselves. How can he marry then?…</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> You must consider what will be best.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Where's the hurry for him to get married?
Marriage is not that sort of thing, it's not like ripe raspberries
that drop off if not picked in time.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> If he were to get married, 'twould be a good
thing in a way.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> We'd like to … what d'you call it? 'Cos why,
you see. I've what d'you call it … a job. I mean, I've
found a paying job in town, you know.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> And a fine job too—cleaning out cesspools.
The other day when he came home, I could do nothing
but spew and spew. Faugh!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> It's true, at first it does seem what d'you call it
… knocks one clean over, you know,—the smell, I
mean. But one gets used to it, and then it's nothing,
no worse than malt grain, and then it's, what d'you call it,
… pays, pays, I mean. And as to the smell being, what
d'you call it, it's not for the likes of us to complain. And
one changes one's clothes. So we'd like to take what's
his name … Nikíta I mean, home. Let him manage
things at home while I, what d'you call it,—earn something
in town.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> You want to keep your son at home? Yes, that
would be well: but how about the money he has had in
advance?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> That's it, that's it! It's just as you say, Ignátitch,
it's just what d'you call it. 'Cos why? If you go into
service, it's as good as if you had sold yourself, they say.
That will be all right. I mean he may stay and serve
his time, only he must, what d'you call it, get married.
I mean—so: you let him off for a little while, that he
may, what d'you call it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Yes, we could manage that.</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Ah, but it's not yet settled between ourselves,
Peter Ignátitch. I'll speak to you as I would
before God, and you may judge between my old man and
me. He goes on harping on that marriage. But just
ask—who it is he wants him to marry. If it were a girl
of the right sort now— I am not my child's enemy, but
the wench is not honest.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> No, that's wrong! Wrong, I say. 'Cos why?
She, that same girl—it's my son as has offended, offended
the girl I mean.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> How offended?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> That's how. She's what d'you call it, with him,
with my son, Nikíta. With Nikíta, what d'you call it, I
mean.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> You wait a bit, my tongue runs smoother—let
me tell it. You know, this lad of ours lived at the
railway before he came to you. There was a girl there as
kept dangling after him. A girl of no account, you know,
her name's Marína. She used to cook for the men. So
now this same girl accuses our son, Nikíta, that he, so to
say, deceived her.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Well, there's nothing good in that.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> But she's no honest girl herself; she runs
after the fellows like a common slut.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> There you are again, old woman, and it's not at
all what d'you call it, it's all not what d'you call it, I
mean …</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> There now, that's all the sense one gets
from my old owl—“what d'you call it, what d'you call
it,” and he doesn't know himself what he means. Peter
Ignátitch, don't listen to me, but go yourself and ask any
one you like about the girl, everybody will say the same.
She's just a homeless good-for-nothing.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> You know, Daddy Akím, if that's how things
are, there's no reason for him to marry her. A daughter-in-law's
not like a shoe, you can't kick her off.</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">AKÍM</span> [<i>excitedly</i>] It's false, old woman, it's what d'you
call it, false; I mean, about the girl; false! 'Cos why?
The lass is a good lass, a very good lass, you know. I'm
sorry, sorry for the lassie, I mean.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> It's an old saying: “For the wide world
old Miriam grieves, and at home without bread her
children she leaves.” He's sorry for the girl, but not
sorry for his own son! Sling her round your neck and
carry her about with you! That's enough of such empty
cackle!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> No, it's not empty.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> There, don't interrupt, let me have my say.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM</span> [<i>interrupts</i>] No, not empty! I mean, you twist
things your own way, about the lass or about <ins title="yourself">yourself.</ins>
Twist them, I mean, to make it better for yourself; but
God, what d'you call it, turns them His way. That's how
it is.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Eh! One only wears out one's tongue with
you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> The lass is hard-working and spruce, and keeps
everything round herself … what d'you call it. And
in our poverty, you know, it's a pair of hands, I mean;
and the wedding needn't cost much. But the chief
thing's the offence, the offence to the lass, and she's a what
d'you call it, an orphan, you know; that's what she is,
and there's the offence.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Eh! they'll all tell you a tale of that sort …</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANÍSYA.</span> Daddy Akím, you'd better listen to us women;
we can tell you a thing or two.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> And God, how about God? Isn't she a human
being, the lass? A what d'you call it,—also a human being
I mean, before God. And how do you look at it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> Eh!… started off again?…</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Wait a bit, Daddy Akím. One can't believe all
these girls say, either. The lad's alive, and not far away;
send for him, and find out straight from him if it's true.
He won't wish to lose his soul. Go and call the fellow,
[<i>Anísya rises</i>] and tell him his father wants him. [<i>Exit
Anísya</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> That's right, dear friend; you've cleared
the way clean, as with water. Yes, let the lad speak for
himself. Nowadays, you know, they'll not let you force a
son to marry; one must first of all ask the lad. He'll
never consent to marry her and disgrace himself, not for
all the world. To my thinking, it's best he should go on
living with you and serving you as his master. And we
need not take him home for the summer either; we can
hire a help. If you would only give us ten roubles now,
we'll let him stay on.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> All in good time. First let us settle one thing
before we start another.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> You see, Peter Ignátitch, I speak. 'Cos why?
you know how it happens. We try to fix things up as
seems best for ourselves, you know; and as to God, we
what d'you call it, we forget Him. We think it's best
so, turn it our own way, and lo! we've got into a fix, you
know. We think it will be best, I mean; and lo! it turns
out much worse—without God, I mean.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Of course one must not forget God.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> It turns out worse! But when it's the right
way—God's way—it what d'you call it, it gives one joy;
seems pleasant, I mean. So I reckon, you see, get him,
the lad, I mean, get him to marry her, to keep him from
sin, I mean, and let him what d'you call it at home,
as it's lawful, I mean, while I go and get the job in town.
The work is of the right sort—it's payin', I mean. And
in God's sight it's what d'you call it—it's best, I mean.
Ain't she an orphan? Here, for example, a year ago
some fellows went and took timber from the steward,—thought
they'd do the steward, you know. Yes, they
did the steward, but they couldn't what d'you call it—do
God, I mean. Well, and so …</p>

<p>
<i>Enter Nikíta and Nan.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> You called me? [<i>Sits down and takes out his
tobacco-pouch</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER</span> [<i>in a low, reproachful voice</i>] What are you thinking
about—have you no manners? Your father is going
to speak to you, and you sit down and fool about with
tobacco. Come, get up!</p>

<p><i>Nikíta rises, leans carelessly with his elbow on the table, and
smiles.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> It seems there's a complaint, you know, about
you, Nikíta—a complaint, I mean, a complaint.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Who's been complaining?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> Complaining? It's a maid, an orphan maid, complaining,
I mean. It's her, you know—a complaint against
you, from Marína, I mean.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>laughs</i>] Well, that's a good one. What's the
complaint? And who's told you—she herself?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> It's I am asking you, and you must now, what
d'you call it, give me an answer. Have you got mixed
up with the lass, I mean—mixed up, you know?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> I don't know what you mean. What's up?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> Foolin', I mean, what d'you call it? foolin'.
Have you been foolin' with her, I mean?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Never mind what's been! Of course one does
have some fun with a cook now and then to while away
the time. One plays the concertina and gets her to
dance. What of that?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Don't shuffle, Nikíta, but answer your father
straight out.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM</span> [<i>solemnly</i>] You can hide it from men but not
from God, Nikíta. You, what d'you call it—think, I
mean, and don't tell lies. She's an orphan; so, you see,
any one is free to insult her. An orphan, you see. So
you should say what's rightest.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> But what if I have nothing to say? I have
told you everything—because there isn't anything to tell,
that's flat! [<i>Getting excited</i>] She can go and say anything
about me, same as if she was speaking of one as is dead.
Why don't she say anything about Fédka Mikíshin? Besides,
how's this, that one mayn't even have a bit of fun
nowadays? And as for her, well, she's free to say anything
she likes.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> Ah, Nikíta, mind! A lie will out. Did anything
happen?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>aside</i>] How he sticks to it; it's too bad. [<i>To
Akím</i>] I tell you, I know nothing more. There's been
nothing between us. [<i>Angrily</i>] By God! and may I never
leave this spot [<i>crosses himself</i>] if I know anything about
it. [<i>Silence. Then still more excitedly</i>] Why! have you
been thinking of getting me to marry her? What do
you mean by it?—it's a confounded shame. Besides,
nowadays you've got no such rights as to force a fellow to
marry. That's plain enough. Besides, haven't I sworn I
know nothing about it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> [<i>to her husband</i>] There now, that's just like
your silly pate, to believe all they tell you. He's gone
and put the lad to shame all for nothing. The best thing
is to let him live as he is living, with his master. His
master will help us in our present need, and give us ten
roubles, and when the time comes …</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Well, Daddy Akím, how's it to be?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM</span> [<i>looks at his son, clicking his tongue disapprovingly</i>]
Mind, Nikíta, the tears of one that's been wronged
never, what d'you call it—never fall beside the mark but
always on, what's name—the head of the man as did the
wrong. So mind, don't what d'you call it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>sits down</i>] What's there to mind? mind yourself.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN</span> [<i>aside</i>] I must run and tell mother. [<i>Exit</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA</span> [<i>to Peter</i>] That's always the way with this
old mumbler of mine, Peter Ignátitch. Once he's got
anything wedged in his pate there's no knocking it out.
We've gone and troubled you all for nothing. The lad
can go on living as he has been. Keep him; he's your
servant.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Well, Daddy Akím, what do you say?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> Why, the lad's his own master, if only he what
d'you call it.… I only wish that, what d'you call it, I
mean.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> You don't know yourself what you're jawing
about. The lad himself has no wish to leave. Besides,
what do we want with him at home? We can manage
without him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Only one thing, Daddy Akím—if you are thinking
of taking him back in summer, I don't want him here
for the winter. If he is to stay at all, it must be for the
whole year.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> And it's for a year he'll bind himself. If
we want help when the press of work comes, we can hire
help, and the lad shall remain with you. Only give us
ten roubles now.…</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Well then, is it to be for another year?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> [<i>sighing</i>] Yes, it seems, it what d'you call it … if
it's so, I mean, it seems that it must be what d'you
call it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MATRYÓNA.</span> For a year, counting from St. Dimítry's
day. We know you'll pay him fair wages. But give us
ten roubles now. Help us out of our difficulties. [<i>Gets
up and bows to Peter</i>].</p>

<p><i>Enter Nan and Anísya. The latter sits down at one side.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Well, if that's settled we might step across to
the inn and have a drink. Come, Daddy Akím, what do
you say to a glass of vódka?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> No, I never drink that sort of thing.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> Well, you'll have some tea?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKÍM.</span> Ah, tea! yes, I do sin that way. Yes, tea's the
thing.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER.</span> And the women will also have some tea. Come.
And you, Nikíta, go and drive the sheep in and clear
away the straw.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> All right. [<i>Exeunt all but Nikíta. Nikíta lights
a cigarette. It grows darker</i>] Just see how they bother
one. Want a fellow to tell 'em how he larks about
with the wenches! It would take long to tell 'em all
those stories—“Marry her,” he says. Marry them all!
One would have a good lot of wives! And what need
have I to marry? Am as good as married now! There's
many a chap as envies me. Yet how strange it felt when
I crossed myself before the icón. It was just as if
some one shoved me. The whole web fell to pieces at
once. They say it's frightening to swear what's not
true. That's all humbug. It's all talk, that is. It's
simple enough.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA</span> [<i>enters with a rope, which she puts down. She
takes off her outdoor things and goes into closet</i>] You might
at least have got a light.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> What, to look at you? I can see you well
enough without.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> Oh, bother you!</p>

<p><i>Nan enters and whispers to Nikíta.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Nikíta, there's a person wants you. There is!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> What person?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Marína from the railway; she's out there, round
the corner.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Nonsense!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Blest if she isn't!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> What does she want?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> She wants you to come out. She says, “I only
want to say a word to Nikíta.” I began asking, but she
won't tell, but only says, “Is it true he's leaving you?”
And I say, “No, only his father wanted to take him away
and get him to marry, but he won't, and is going to stay
with us another year.” And she says, “For goodness'
sake send him out to me. I must see him,” she says, “I
must say a word to him somehow.” She's been waiting a
long time. Why don't you go?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Bother her! What should I go for?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> She says, “If he don't come, I'll go into the hut
to him.” Blest if she didn't say she'd come in!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Not likely. She'll wait a bit and then go
away.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> “Or is it,” she says, “that they want him to marry
Akoulína?”</p>

<p><i>Re-enter Akoulína, passing near Nikíta to take her distaff.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> Marry whom to Akoulína?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN.</span> Why, Nikíta.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> A likely thing! Who says it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>looks at her and laughs</i>] It seems people do say it.
Would you marry me, Akoulína?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> Who, you? Perhaps I might have afore,
but I won't now.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> And why not now?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> 'Cos you wouldn't love me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Why not?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> 'Cos you'd be forbidden to. [<i>Laughs</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Who'd forbid it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> Who? My step-mother. She does nothing
but grumble, and is always staring at you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>laughing</i>] Just hear her! Ain't she cute?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> Who? Me? What's there to be cute about?
Am I blind? She's been rowing and rowing at dad all
day. The fat-muzzled witch! [<i>Goes into closet</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NAN</span> [<i>looking out of the window</i>] Look, Nikíta, she's coming!
I'm blest if she isn't! I'll go away. [<i>Exit</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARÍNA</span> [<i>enters</i>] What are you doing with me?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Doing? I'm not doing anything.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARÍNA.</span> You mean to desert me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>gets up angrily</i>] What does this look like, your
coming here?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARÍNA.</span> Oh, Nikíta!</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Well, you are strange! What have you come for?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARÍNA.</span> Nikíta!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> That's my name. What do you want with
Nikíta? Well, what next? Go away, I tell you!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARÍNA.</span> I see, you do want to throw me over.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Well, and what's there to remember? You
yourself don't know. When you stood out there round
the corner and sent Nan for me, and I didn't come,
wasn't it plain enough that you're not wanted? It seems
pretty simple. So there—go!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARÍNA.</span> Not wanted! So now I'm not wanted! I
believed you when you said you would love me. And
now that you've ruined me, I'm not wanted.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Where's the good of talking? This is quite
improper. You've been telling tales to father. Now, do
go away, will you?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARÍNA.</span> You know yourself I never loved any one but
you. Whether you married me or not, I'd not have been
angry. I've done you no wrong, then why have you
left off caring for me? Why?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Where's the use of baying at the moon? You
go away. Goodness me! what a duffer!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARÍNA.</span> It's not that you deceived me when you promised
to marry me that hurts, but that you've left off loving.
No, it's not that you've stopped loving me either, but
that you've changed me for another, that's what hurts.
I know who it is!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>comes up to her viciously</i>] Eh! what's the good
of talking to the likes of you, that won't listen to reason?
Be off, or you'll drive me to do something you'll be
sorry for.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARÍNA.</span> What, will you strike me, then? Well then,
strike me! What are you turning away for? Ah,
Nikíta!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Supposing some one came in. Of course, it's
quite improper. And what's the good of talking?</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">MARÍNA.</span> So this is the end of it! What has been has
flown. You want me to forget it? Well then, Nikíta,
listen. I kept my maiden honour as the apple of my eye.
You have ruined me for nothing, you have deceived me.
You have no pity on a fatherless and motherless girl!
[<i>Weeping</i>] You have deserted, you have killed me, but I
bear you no malice. God forgive you! If you find a
better one you'll forget me, if a worse one you'll
remember me. Yes, you will remember, Nikíta! Good-bye,
then, if it is to be. Oh, how I loved you! Good-bye
for the last time. [<i>Takes his head in her hands and tries
to kiss him</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA</span> [<i>tossing his head back</i>] I'm not going to talk with
the likes of you. If you won't go away I will, and you
may stay here by yourself.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARÍNA</span> [<i>screams</i>] You are a brute. [<i>In the doorway</i>]
God will give you no joy. [<i>Exit, crying</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA</span> [<i>comes out of closet</i>] You're a dog, Nikíta!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> What's up?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> What a cry she gave! [<i>Cries</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> What's up with you?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKOULÍNA.</span> What's up? You've hurt her so. That's
the way you'll hurt me also. You're a dog. [<i>Exit into
closet</i>].</p>

<p><i>Silence.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">NIKÍTA.</span> Here's a fine muddle. I'm as sweet as honey
on the lasses, but when a fellow's sinned with 'em it's a
bad look-out!</p>
